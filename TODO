Minor
=====

* make sure the man pages are complete and up-to-date

* validator should error if a field is there more than once
  (done in parent, not yet in splitoffs).

* long validator wishlist in Validation.pm

* Validator should complain if %p/share/gtk-doc is not in a package which
  is BuildDependsOnly: true

Medium
======

* replace "fink list --help" by a general "fink --help [command]" similiar to 
  how CVS does it (e.g. try "cvs -H update")

* checksums should always be checked whenever we know we are going to use a given
  source file later. E.g. if you run "fink rebuild foo", then Fink does check 
  if the source files for package foo are present, and if not, downloads them.
  If present, fink should verify the checksum *immediatly*, in addition to the
  current check (just prior to decompressing the archive).

* add a mirror check utillity that given some testcases will verify that all mirrors
  do still work
  
* when Fink asks a user to choose between alternatives, it should remember the
choice. (But will this ever break building?)

* when a package is very new, the source is not yet on a master. This case is
very common and needs to be dealt with much better.

Major
=====
* rewrite the dependency code
  -> added Conflicts / BuildConflicts support

* it might be useful to sync the finkinfodb as a single file per-tree, via
rsync. This way users don't have to download all the .info files. Profiling
would be needed. And what about .patch?

* Spotlight might be able to notice new .info files for Fink, so updating can
happen in the background.

* there should be a better way than passwd for packages to use new user/groups.
See branch UID/GID.

* as much as possible of fink should work as non-root. Especially important that
'fink build' should work, in case we ever want to use a build farm.
