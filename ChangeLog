2001-10-17  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* fink.in: Becoming root is now handled by Fink::Engine. Remove
	CDPATH from the environment. Some other restructuring.

	* fink.in: Eliminated the remaining Fink::Config dependencies. The
	big modules are loaded only when needed. Now uses Getopt::Long to
	parse command line options (more to come in that department).

	* setup.sh: Hardcode base path into FinkVersion.pm.

2001-10-13  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	in the overall shape for a 1.0 release.

2001-09-11  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* fink.in: Use methods of FinkVersion if possible.

	* bootstrap.pl: Removed special treatment of base-files. Use
	fink.info.in instead of packages/fink.in to generate the fink
	package description. Don't create FinkVersion.pm.

	fink.info.in instead of packages/fink.in to generate the fink
	package description. Don't create FinkVersion.pm.

	(previously done independently in inject.pl, bootstrap.pl and
	mkrelease.sh).

	distribution version on 'fink --version'.

	Updated for the 0.2.6 release via the XML document system.

	been checked for completeness. Changed stable/bootstrap to
	local/bootstrap. Runs the scanpackages command at the end of
	bootstrap. Final message reworded after a suggestion from Tom
	Sobczynski.
	* inject.pl: Use the modules from the perlmod directory. Changed
	stable/bootstrap to local/bootstrap. Adds local/bootstrap to
	fink.conf if required.

2001-09-03  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	to put all binaries in BASEPATH/bin.
