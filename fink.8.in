.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a package management system that aims to bring the full world
of GNU and other common Open Source software to Darwin and Mac OS X.
.Pp
With the help of
.Xr dpkg 8
it maintains a separate directory hierarchy. It
downloads original source releases, patches them if neccessary, configures
them for Darwin and compiles and installs them. The information about
available packages and the neccessary patches are included with this
distribution, everything else is downloaded off the Internet.

.\" COMMANDS
.\"
.\"
.Sh COMMANDS
.Nm
has several commands that work on packages. All of them need at least
one package name, and all can handle several package names at once. You can
specify just the package name (e.g. gimp), or a fully qualified name with a
version number (e.g. gimp-1.2.1 or gimp-1.2.1-3). Fink will automatically
choose the latest available version and revision when they are not
specified.
.\" List of commands
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Cm install Ar package...
The install command is used to install packages. It downloads, configure,
builds and installs the packages you name. It will also install required
dependencies automatically, but will ask you for confirmation before it
does so.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Cm update, enable, activate, use
.It Cm remove Ar package...
The remove command removes packages from the system by calling
.Ql "dpkg --remove".
The current implementation has some flaws: It only works on
packages Fink knows about (i.e. where an .info file is present); and it
doesn't check dependencies itself but rather completly leaves that to the
dpkg tool (usually this poses no problem, though).
.Pp
The remove command removes the actual package files (excluding configuration
files), but leaves the .deb compressed package file intact. This means that you 
can re-install the package later without going through the compile process again. 
If you need the disk space, you can remove the .deb from the 
.Pa @PREFIX@/fink/dists
tree.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Cm disable, deactivate, unuse, delete
.It Cm purge Ar package...
The purge command purges packages from the system by calling
.Ql "dpkg --purge".
This is the same as
.Cm fink remove
except that it removes configuration files as well.
.It Cm update-all
This command updates all installed packages to the latest version. It does
not need a package list, so you just type:
.Dl Cm fink update-all
.It Cm list Op Ar package...
This command produces a list of available packages, listing installation
status, the latest version and a short description. If you call it without
parameters, it will list all available packages. You can also pass a name or
a shell pattern, and fink will list all packages that match.
.Pp
The first column displays the installation state with the following meanings:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It \ 
not installed
.It \ i
latest version is installed
.It (i)
installed, but a newer version is available
.El
.Pp
Some usage examples:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent
.It Cm fink list
list all packages
.It Cm fink list bash
check if bash is available and what version
.It Cm fink list Qq "gnome*"
list all packages that start with 'gnome'.
.El
.Pp
The quotes in the last example are necessary to stop the shell from
interpreting the pattern itself.
.It Cm fink apropos Ar package...
This command behaves similarly to
.Cm fink list
except that
.Ar package...
must be supplied and it searches package descriptions as well as package
names.
.It Cm describe Ar package...
This command displays a description of the package you name on the command
line. Note that only a small part of the packages currently have a
description.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Cm desc, description, info
.It Cm fetch Ar package...
Downloads the named packages, but does not install it. This command will
download the tarballs even if they were downloaded before.
.It Cm fetch-all
Downloads
.Em all
package source files. Like fetch, this downloads the
tarballs even when they were downloaded before.
.It Cm fetch-missing
Downloads
.Em all
package source files. This command will only download files
that are not present on the system.
.It Cm build Ar package...
Builds a package, but does not install it. As usual, the source tarballs are
downloaded if they can not be found. The result of this command is an
installable .deb package file, which you can quickly install later with the
install command. This command will do nothing if the .deb already exists.
Note that dependencies are still 
.Em installed,
not just built.
.It Cm rebuild Ar package...
Builds a package (like the
.Cm build
command), but ignores and overwrites the existing .deb file. If the
package is installed, the newly created .deb file will also be installed
in the system via
.Xr dpkg 8 .
Very useful during package development.
.It Cm reinstall Ar package...
Same as install, but will install the package via
.Xr dpkg 8
even when it is already installed. You can use this when you accidentally
deleted package files or changed configuration files and want to get the
default settings back.
.It Cm configure
Reruns the
.Nm
configuration process. This will let you change your mirror sites and
proxy settings, among others.
.It Cm selfupdate
This command automates the process of upgrading to a new
.Nm
release. It checks the
.Nm
website to see if a new version is available. It then downloads the package
descriptions and updates the core packages, including
.Nm
itself. This command can upgrade to regular releases, but it can also
setup your @PREFIX@/fink/dists directory tree for direct CVS updates.
This means that you then will be able to access the very latest
revisions of all packages.
.It Cm index
Rebuilds the package cache. You should not normally need to execute this manually,
.Nm
should auto-detect when it needs to be updated.
.It Cm validate Ar file...
This command performs various checks on .info and .deb files. Package maintainers 
should run this on their package descriptions and corresponding built
packages before submitting them.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Cm check
.It Cm scanpackages Op Ar tree...
Calls
.Xr dpkg-scanpackages 8
with the specified trees.
.It Cm checksums
Validates the MD5 digest of all packages' tarballs, where possible.
.It Cm cleanup
Removes obsolete package files (.info, .patch, .deb) if newer versions
are available. This can reclaim large amounts of disk space.
.El

.\" FILES
.\"
.\"
.Sh FILES
.Pa @PREFIX@/var/db/fink.db
.Bd -filled -offset indent -compact
Package cache database. Don't try to edit this manually, instead update it using
.Cm fink index.
.Ed
.Pp
.Pa @PREFIX@/etc/fink.conf
.Bd -filled -offset indent -compact
The system wide configuration file. You should not need to edit this file 
manually, but rather use
.Cm fink configure
to change fink's settings.
The following fields are useful to know something about:
.Bl -inset -offset
.It Em Trees:
Sets where fink looks for the .info files which describe the packages.
Normally used to choose between the stable/main and unstable/main trees.
Edit this line to use the unstable tree if you want to install packages
from the unstable section, but remember to set it back to use stable
afterwards if you want to use mostly stable packages.
Remember to give some feedback to the package maintainer if you use
unstable packages, you may be the only thing stopping the package from 
being moved into the stable tree.
.It Em ProxyPassiveFTP:
It is safest to set this to true, it is the default.
.It Em FetchAltDir:
This is the alternative directory where fink looks for sources.
If you download a package source file (usually .tar.gz) and put it in
this directory, fink will find it and will not download the source again.
.It Em DownloadMethod:
You have a choice of using either curl or wget to download. 
Set this to wget if you want to use wget for some reason,
the default is currently curl.
.It Em KeepBuildDir:
The default is false, fink usually removes the source build directory after 
successfully building a package. If you want to keep the build directory,
set this to true. Usually only developers have any need for this field.
.It Em KeepRootDir:
Similar to the KeepBuildDir option, this allows developers to keep the root
directory around for debugging purposes.
.It Em ProxyHTTP:
This line is your HTTP proxy settings. You may find it easier to edit this
line directly rather than running fink configure.
.It Em ProxyFTP:
Your ftp proxy settings.
.It Em Verbose:
A true or false value which tells fink how verbose it should be.

This file also contains all of your mirror settings, which should be chosen using
.Cm fink configure.
