.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a package management system that aims to bring the full world
of GNU and other common Open Source software to Darwin and Mac OS X.
.Pp
With the help of
.Xr dpkg 8
and
.Xr apt 8
it maintains a separate directory hierarchy. It
downloads original source releases, patches them if neccessary, configures
them for Darwin and compiles and installs them. The information about
available packages and the neccessary patches are included with this
distribution, everything else is downloaded off the Internet.
.\"
.\"
.\" OPTIONS
.\"
.\"
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Cm -h, --help
Display help text.
.It Cm -q, --quiet
Causes fink to be less verbose, opposite of
.Cm --verbose
.It Cm -V, --version
Display fink version information.
.It Cm -v, --verbose
Causes fink to be more verbose, opposite of
.Cm --quiet
.It Cm -y, --yes
Assume default answer for all interactive questions
.It Cm -K, --keep-root-dir
Causes Fink not to delete the temporary installation directory
.Pa root-[name]-[version]-[revision]
in the
.Cm Buildpath
(see the
.Cm fink.conf
manpage) after building a package.
.It Cm -k, --keep-build-dir
Causes Fink not to delete the package compile directory
.Pa [name]-[version]-[revision]
in the
.Cm Buildpath
(see the
.Cm fink.conf
manpage) after building a package.
.It Cm -b, --use-binary-dist
Download pre-compiled binary packages from the binary distribution 
if available and if deb is not already on the system
.Pp
Note that this mode instructs Fink to download the version it wants if
that version is available for download; it does not cause Fink to
choose a version based on its binary availability.
.It Cm --no-use-binary-dist
Don't use pre-compiled binary packages from the binary distribution,
opposite of the
.Cm --use-binary-dist
flag. This is the default unless overridden by a setting in
.Pa fink.conf
configuration file.
.It Cm --build-as-nobody
Drop to a non-root user when performing the unpack, patch, compile,
and install phases.
.It Cm -m, --maintainer
Perform actions useful to package maintainers: run validation on
the .info file before building and on the .deb after building a
package; turn certain build-time warnings into fatal errors; run the
test suites as specified in the InfoTest field.  This sets
.Pa --tests
and
.Pa --validate
to 
.Pa on .
.It Cm --tests[=on|off|warn]
Causes InfoTest fields to be activated and test suites specified via
TestScript to be executed.  If no argument is given to this option or if the
argument is
.Pa on
then failures in test suites will be considered fatal errors during builds.
If the argument is
.Pa warn
then failures will be treated as warnings.
.It Cm --validate[=on|off|warn]
Causes packages to be validated during a build.
If no argument is given to this option or if the argument is
.Pa on
then validation failures will be considered fatal errors during builds.
If the argument is
.Pa warn
then failures will be treated as warnings.
.It Cm -l, --log-output
Save a copy of the terminal output during each package building
process. By default, the file is stored in
.Pa /tmp/fink-build-log_[name]-[version]-[revision]_[date]-[time]
but one can use the
.Cm --logfile
flag to specify an alternate filename.
.It Cm --no-log-output
Don't save a copy of the output during package-building, opposite of the
.Cm --log-output
flag. This is the default.
.It Cm --logfile=filename
Save package build logs to the file
.Pa filename
instead of the default file (see the
.Cm --log-output
flag, which is implicitly set by the
.Cm --logfile
flag). You can use percent-expansion codes to include specific package
information automatically. A complete list of percent-expanions is
available in the Fink Packaging Manual; some common percent-expansions
are:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm %n
package name
.It Cm %v
package version
.It Cm %r
package revision
.El
.It Cm -t, --trees=expr
Consider only packages in trees matching
.Pa expr .
.Pp
The format of
.Pa expr
is a comma-delimited list of tree specifications. Trees listed in
.Pa fink.conf
are compared against
.Pa expr .
Only those which match at
least one tree specification are considered by fink, in the order of the first
specifications which they match. If no
.Cm --trees
option is used, all trees listed in
.Pa fink.conf
are included in order.
.Pp
A tree specification
may contain a slash
.Pq /
character, in which case it requires an exact match with a tree. Otherwise, it
matches against the first path-element of a tree. For example,
.Cm --trees=unstable/main
would match only the
.Cm unstable/main
tree, while
.Cm --trees=unstable
would match both
.Cm unstable/main
and
.Cm unstable/crypto .
.Pp
There exist magic tree specifications which can be included in
.Pa expr :
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent
.It Cm status
Includes packages in the dpkg status database.
.It Cm virtual
Includes virtual packages which reflect the capabilities of the system.
.El
.Pp
Exclusion (or failure to include) these magic trees is currently only supported
for operations which do not install or remove packages.
.It Cm -T, --exclude-trees=expr
Consider only packages in trees not matching
.Pa expr .
.Pp
The syntax of
.Pa expr
is the same as for
.Cm --trees ,
including the magic tree specifications. However, matching trees are here
excluded rather than included. Note that trees matching both
.Cm --trees
and
.Cm --exclude-trees
are excluded.
.Pp
Examples of
.Cm --trees
and
.Cm --exclude-trees :
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent
.It Cm fink --trees=stable,virtual,status install foo
Install
.Cm foo
as if fink was using the stable tree, even if unstable is enabled in
.Pa fink.conf .
.It Cm fink --exclude-trees=local install foo
Install the version of
.Cm foo
in fink, not the locally modified version.
.It Cm fink --trees=local/main list -i
List the locally modified packages which are installed.
.El
.El
.\"
.\"
.\" COMMANDS
.\"
.\"
.Sh COMMANDS
.Nm
has several commands that work on packages. All of them need at least
one package name, and all can handle several package names at once. You can
specify just the package name (e.g. gimp), or a fully qualified name with a
version number (e.g. gimp-1.2.1 or gimp-1.2.1-3). Fink will automatically
choose the latest available version and revision when they are not
specified.
.\" List of commands
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Cm install Ar package...
The install command is used to install packages. It downloads, configures,
and builds, or downloads prebuilt (see the
.Cm --use-binary-dist
flag) and installs the packages you name. It will also install required
dependencies automatically, but will ask you for confirmation before it
does so.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Cm update, enable, activate, use
.It Cm remove Ar package...
The remove command removes packages from the system.
The current implementation has a flaw: it
doesn't check dependencies itself but rather completly leaves that to the
dpkg or apt-get tool (usually this poses no problem, though).
.Pp
The remove command removes the actual package files (excluding configuration
files), but leaves the .deb compressed package file intact. This means that you 
can re-install the package later without going through the compile process again. 
If you need the disk space, you can remove the .deb from the 
.Pa @PREFIX@/fink/dists
tree.
.Pp
These flags can be used with the 
.Cm fink remove
command
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm -h,--help
Show the options which are available.
.It Cm -r,--recursive
Also remove packages that depend on the package(s) to be removed.
.El
.Pp
Aliases:
.Cm disable, deactivate, unuse, delete
.Pp
.It Cm purge Ar package...
The purge command purges packages from the system.
This is the same as
.Cm fink remove
except that it removes configuration files as well.
.Pp
These flags can be used with the 
.Cm fink purge
command
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm -h,--help
Show the options which are available.
.It Cm -r,--recursive
Also purge packages that depend on the package(s) to be purged.
.El
.Pp
.It Cm update-all
This command updates all installed packages to the latest version. It does
not need a package list, so you just type:
.Dl Cm fink update-all
.It Cm list Oo Ar list-options Oc Op Ar package...
This command produces a list of available packages. If no packages are
specified, it will list all available packages. If one or more package
names are given, fink will list only those packages that match the
given names. If the passed package named contain shell globs (?  and *
wildcards), only those packages matching the glob are returned. If
simple text strings (not globs) are passed, packages containing them
as substrings of the name are returned.
.Pp
The default output is a table, listing installation state, the latest
version and a short package description. The first column displays the
installation state with the following meanings:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It \ 
not installed
.It \ i
latest version is installed
.It (i)
some version is installed, but a newer version is available
.It *i*
the version which is installed is more recent than the newest version currently available
.It \ p
a virtual package provided by a package that is installed
.El
.Pp
The version column always lists the latest (highest) version known for
the package, regardless of what version (if any) you have
installed. To see all versions of a package available on your system
along with more detailed status information about each, use
.Cm fink dumpinfo -fallversions
.Pp
The following
.Cm list-options
affect the output format:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm -h,--help
Show the options which are available.
.It Cm -w xyz,--width=xyz
Sets the width of the display you would like the output
formatted for. xyz is either a numeric value or auto.
auto will set the width based on the terminal width.
The default is auto.
.It Cm -t,--tab
The default table format has fixed-width columns that are adjusted to
fill the available screen size, with package names and descriptions
truncated as necessary to fit. In
.Cm -t
mode, the output is tab delimited and fields are not truncated
regardles of screen size. The tabbed mode is useful for running the
output through additional scripts or parsers, and is the default
format when
.Cm fink list
is used as part of a pipeline rather than as a simple command.
.It Cm --format=table
Output results in the standard fixed-width or tab-delimited table
style. See the
.Cm -t
flag for a way to affect the format, and the intro to this command for
general information about the layout.
.It Cm --format=dotty
Output package dependency data in .dot format, suitable for processing
by
.Cm dotty
and other
.Cm graphviz
tools (compare to the human-readable list format of the
.Cm fink show-deps
command). This output mode just gives runtime dependencies of each
package You can parse the output to get reverse-depends
information, for example:
.Dl fink list --format=dotty | grep ' \*[q]libgettext8-shlibs\*[q]'
will list all packages that have a runtime dependency on the
libgettext8-shlibs package. Technically, this example lists all
packages' runtime dependency data, and then selects the lines that
have libgettext8-shlibs in the dependency-target field. Note, there is
a single space between the two different quotes before the
package-name but not after.
.It Cm --format=dotty-build
Output package dependency data in .dot format, suitable for processing
by
.Cm dotty
and other
.Cm graphviz
tools (compare to the human-readable list format of the
.Cm fink show-deps
command). This output mode gives compiletime dependencies of each
package, which includes runtime and build dependencies of every
package in a family (packages built together). Using the
.Cm -m
flag will also include dependencies for the package-family's
self-testing (i.e., including TestDepends data). You can parse the
output to get reverse-builddepends information, for example:
.Dl fink -m list --format=dotty-build | grep ' \*[q]libgettext8-dev\*[q]'
will list all packages that have a compiletime dependency on the
libgettext8-dev package. Technically, this example lists all
packages' compiletime dependency data, and then selects the lines that
have libgettext8-dev in the dependency-target field. Note, there is
a single space between the two different quotes before the
package-name but not after.
.El
.Pp
The following
.Cm list-options
control which packages are listed:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm -i,--installed
Show only those packages which are currently installed.
.It Cm -o,--outdated
Show only those packages which are out of date.
.It Cm -u,--uptodate
Show only packages which are up to date.
.It Cm -n,--notinstalled
Show packages which are not currently installed.
.It Cm -N,--newer
Show packages whose installed version is newer than anything fink knows about.
.It Cm -s expr,--section=expr
Show only packages in the sections matching expr.
.It Cm -m expr,--maintainer=expr
Show only packages with the maintainer matching expr.
.El
.Pp
Some usage examples:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent
.It Cm fink list
list all packages.
.It Cm fink list bash
check if bash is available and what version.
.It Cm fink list --tab --outdated | cut -f2
just list the names of the out of date packages.
.It Cm fink list --section=kde
list the packages in the kde section.
.It Cm fink list --maintainer=fink-devel
list the packages with no maintainer.
.It Cm fink --trees=unstable list --maintainer=fink-devel
list the packages with no maintainer, but only in the unstable tree.
.It Cm fink list Qq "gnome*"
list all packages that start with 'gnome'.
.El
.Pp
The quotes in the last example are necessary to stop the shell from
interpreting the pattern itself.
.Pp
.It Cm apropos Ar package...
This command behaves similarly to
.Cm fink list
except that
.Ar package...
must be supplied and it searches package descriptions as well as package
names for the given strings (no wildcards).
.It Cm describe Ar package...
This command displays a description of the package you name on the command
line. Note that only a small part of the packages currently have a
description.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Cm desc, description, info
.Pp
.It Cm plugins
List the (optional) plugins available to the fink program.  Currently lists
the notification mechanisms and the source-tarball checksum algorithms.
.Pp
.It Cm fetch Ar package...
Downloads the named packages, but does not install them. This command will
download the tarballs even if they were downloaded before.
.Pp
These flags can be used with the 
.Cm fink fetch
command
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm -h,--help
Show the options which are available.
.It Cm -i,--ignore-restrictive
Do not fetch packages that are "License: Restrictive". Useful for mirrors, because
some restrictive packages do not allow source mirroring.
.It Cm -d,--dry-run
Just display information about the file(s) that would be downloaded
for the package(s) to be fetched; do not actually download anything.
.It Cm -r,--recursive
Also fetch packages that are dependencies of the package(s) to be fetched.
.El
.Pp
.It Cm fetch-all
Downloads
.Em all
package source files. Like fetch, this downloads the
tarballs even when they were downloaded before.
.Pp
These flags can be used with the 
.Cm fink fetch-all
command
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm -h,--help
Show the options which are available.
.It Cm -i,--ignore-restrictive
Do not fetch packages that are "License: Restrictive". Useful for mirrors, because
some restrictive packages do not allow source mirroring.
.It Cm -d,--dry-run
Just display information about the file(s) that would be downloaded
for the package(s) to be fetched; do not actually download anything.
.El
.Pp
.It Cm fetch-missing
Downloads
.Em all
package source files. This command will only download files
that are not present on the system.
.Pp
These flags can be used with the 
.Cm fink fetch-missing
command
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm -h,--help
Show the options which are available.
.It Cm -i,--ignore-restrictive
Do not fetch packages that are "License: Restrictive". Useful for mirrors, because
some restrictive packages do not allow source mirroring.
.It Cm -d,--dry-run
Just display information about the file(s) that would be downloaded
for the package(s) to be fetched; do not actually download anything.
.El
.Pp
.It Cm build Ar package...
Builds a package, but does not install it. As usual, the source tarballs are
downloaded if they can not be found. The result of this command is an
installable .deb package file, which you can quickly install later with the
install command. This command will do nothing if the .deb already exists.
Note that dependencies are still 
.Em installed,
not just built.
.It Cm rebuild Ar package...
Builds a package (like the
.Cm build
command), but ignores and overwrites the existing .deb file. If the
package is installed, the newly created .deb file will also be installed
in the system via
.Xr dpkg 8 .
Very useful during package development.
.It Cm reinstall Ar package...
Same as install, but will install the package via
.Xr dpkg 8
even when it is already installed. You can use this when you accidentally
deleted package files or changed configuration files and want to get the
default settings back.
.It Cm configure
Reruns the
.Nm
configuration process. This will let you change your mirror sites and
proxy settings, among others.
.It Cm selfupdate Ar [options]
This command automates the process of upgrading to a new
.Nm
release. It checks the
.Nm
website to see if a new version is available. It then downloads the package
descriptions and updates the core packages, including
.Nm
itself. This command can upgrade to major point releases (for example,
the set of packages that comes with a Fink binary installer), but it can also
set up your
.Pa @PREFIX@/fink/dists
directory tree for
.Xr cvs 1
or
.Xr rsync 1
updates.
This means that you then will be able to access the very latest
revisions of all packages instead of only the point-release snapshot. If no
.Ar options
are given, the existing default update method is used as given in the
.Xr fink.conf 5
file. Several
.Ar options
can be used to control the update process:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm -h,--help
Show the options which are available.
.It Cm -m MODE,--method=METHOD
Establish the given METHOD as the default selfupdate method and update
using it.
.It Cm -f, --finish
Do some standard actions after the actual MODE-specific updating of
the package descriptions (update the binary-repository data, refresh
some internal indices, make sure
.Ar fink
itself and some other critical packages are up-to-date).
.El
.It Cm selfupdate-rsync
Synonym for
.Cm selfupdate --method=rsync
.It Cm selfupdate-cvs
Synonym for
.Cm selfupdate --method=cvs
.It Cm index
Rebuilds the package cache. You should not normally need to execute this manually,
.Nm
should auto-detect when it needs to be updated.
.It Cm validate Ar [options] file...
This command performs various checks on .info and .deb files. Package maintainers 
should run this on their package descriptions and corresponding built
packages before submitting them.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Cm check
.Pp
The following optional
.Ar options
may be used:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm -h,--help
Show the options which are available.
.It Cm -p,--prefix
Simulate an alternate Fink basepath prefix (%p) within the files being validated.
.It Cm --pedantic, --no-pedantic
Control the display of nitpicky formatting warnings.
.Cm --pedantic
is the default.
.El
.It Cm scanpackages Op Ar tree...
Updates the
.Xr apt-get 8
database of debs in the specified trees.
.It Cm cleanup Ar [mode(s) and options]
Removes obsolete and temporary files. This can reclaim large amounts of
disk space. One or more modes may be specified:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm --debs
Delete .deb files (compiled binary package archives) corresponding to
versions of packages that are neither described by a package
description (.info) file in the currently-active trees nor presently
installed.
.It Cm --sources,--srcs
Delete sources (tarballs, etc.) that are not used by any package
description (.info) file in the currently-active trees.
.It Cm --buildlocks, --bl
Delete stale buildlock packages.
.It Cm --dpkg-status
Remove entries for packages that are not installed from the dpkg
"status" database.
.It Cm --obsolete-packages
Attempt to uninstall all installed packges that are obsolete.
.It Cm --all
All of the above modes.
.El
If no mode is specified,
.Ar --debs --sources
is the default action. In addition, the following options may be used:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm -k,--keep-src
Move old source files to
.Pa @PREFIX@/src/old/
instead of deleting them.
.It Cm -d,--dry-run
Print the names of the files that would be deleted, but do not
actually delete them.
.It Cm -h,--help
Show the modes and options which are available.
.El
.It Cm dumpinfo Ar [options] package...
Shows how Fink parses parts of a package's .info file. Various fields and
percent expansions will be displayed according to
.Ar options
as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm -h,--help
Show the options which are available.
.It Cm -a,--all
Display all fields from the package description.
This is the default mode when no
.Ar --field
or
.Ar --percent
flags are given.
.It Cm -f fieldname, --field=fieldname
Display the given fieldname(s), in the order listed.
.It Cm -p key, --percent=key
Display the given percent expansion key(s), in the order listed.
.It Cm -e env_var, --env=env_var
Display the given variable(s) from the environment in effect when the
package is compiled. Output is in a form suitable to be fed to 'eval'.
.El
.It Cm show-deps Ar package...
Displays a human-readable list of the compile-time (build) and
run-time (installation) dependencies of the listed package(s). See the
.Cm fink list --format=dotty
and
.Cm fink list --format=dotty-build
commands for other ways of obtaining dependency (and
reverse-dependency) information.
