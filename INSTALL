 Fink 0.38.3 Installation
==========================

These are the installation instructions for the "source" distribution based
on "fink-0.38.3" , intended for use with OS X v.10.7 and later.

This document does not apply to the binary distribution 
[http://www.finkproject.org/download/index.php].

There are instructions for both first time installation and upgrading from a
previous version. Fast track instructions for the impatient are at the top.


 The Fast Track
================

This section is for the impatient who don't want to take the time to learn
their way around the command line world and don't care that they don't know
what they're actually doing.

If you're looking for the real instructions, skip to the next section. (You
can still use this section as an example.)


 Requirements
--------------
You need:

 * An installed Mac OS X system, version 10.7 or later.

 * The Xcode Command Line Tools are mandatory. This package can be installed
   either by downloading it directly via developer.apple.com, through the
   Xcode application, on via the Components page of the Downloads tab of the
   Preferences on 10.7 and 10.8, or on 10.9 and 10.10 by running the

      xcode-select --install

   command and choosing the Install button in the window that pops up, or
   you can install the full Xcode if you prefer. You may also need to use
   this command to update the tools, especially if you're having build
   problems.

   If you're doing a manual download, make sure that the tools you install
   match your Mac OS X version as well as your Xcode app version (if that is
   present).

 * Java. Entering

      javac

   from a Terminal.app window should suffice to make the system download it
   for you.

 * Many other things that come with Mac OS X. This includes perl and curl.

 * Internet access. All source code is downloaded from mirror sites.

 * Patience. Compiling several big packages takes time. I'm talking hours or
   even days here.


 First Time Installation Fast Track
------------------------------------
Start out by copying the "fink-0.38.3.tar.gz" file to your home folder (it
might also show up as "fink-0.38.3.tar" if you used Safari to download it).
Then, open Terminal.app and follow the session below. Computer output is in
"normal face" , your input is in "bold face" (or otherwise highlighted). The
actual input prompts from the shell may vary, and some chunks of the output
have been omitted ( "..." ).

Note: on 10.8, 10.9, and 10.10, after you start the install process you may
see dialog windows asking whether you want to install XQuartz. If you want
to do so, go ahead. You won't have to stop the Fink install to do that.

   [frodo:~] testuser% tar xf fink-0.38.3.tar.gz
   [frodo:~] testuser% cd fink-0.38.3
   [frodo:~/fink-0.38.3] testuser% ./bootstrap
   
   Fink must be installed and run with superuser (root) privileges
   ...
   Choose a method: [1] 1
   
   sudo /Users/testuser/fink-0.38.3/bootstrap .sudo '/sw'
   Password: (your normal password here)
   ...
   OK, I'll ask you some questions and update the configuration file in
   '/sw/etc/fink.conf'.
   
   In what additional directory should Fink look for downloaded tarballs? [] (press return)
   
   Which directory should Fink use to build packages? (If you don't know what this
   means, it is safe to leave it at its default.) [] (press return)
   
   "Fink can set the UID and GID of its build user dynamically...
   ...Allow Fink to set the UID/GID dynamically? [Y] (press return)
   
   (1)	Quiet (do not show download statistics)
   (2)	Low (do not show tarballs being expanded)
   (3)	Medium (will show almost everything)
   (4)	High (will show everything)
   
   How verbose should Fink be? [2] (press return)
   
   Proxy/Firewall settings
   Enter the URL of the HTTP proxy to use, or 'none' for no proxy. The URL
   should start with http:// and may contain username, password or port
   specifications. [none] (press return)
   Enter the URL of the proxy to use for FTP, or 'none' for no proxy. The URL
   should start with http:// and may contain username, password or port
   specifications. [none] (press return)
   Use passive mode FTP transfers (to get through a firewall)? [Y/n] (press return)
   
   Enter the maximum number of simultaneous build jobs.
   ...
   Maximum number of simultaneous build jobs: [<number of cpus>] (press return)
   
   Mirror selection
   Choose a continent:
   ...
   (enter the numbers corresponding to your location)
   ...
   Writing updated configuration to '/sw/etc/fink.conf'...
   Bootstrapping a base system via /sw/bootstrap.
   ...
   (take a coffee break while Fink downloads and compiles the base packages)
   ...
   
   You should now have a working Fink installation in '/sw'.
   [frodo:~/fink-0.38.3] testuser% cd
   [frodo:~] testuser% rm -r fink-0.38.3
   [frodo:~] testuser% /sw/bin/pathsetup.sh

The last command runs a little script to help set up your Unix paths (and
other things) for use with Fink. In most cases, it will run automatically,
and prompt you for permission to make changes. If the script fails, you'll
have to do things by hand (see below).

(If you need to do things by hand, and you are using csh or tcsh, you need
to make sure that the command "source /sw/bin/init.csh" is executed during
startup of your shell, either by .login, .cshrc, .tcshrc, or something else
appropriate. If you are using bash or similar shells, the command you need
is ". /sw/bin/init.sh" , and places where it might get executed include
.bashrc and .profile.)

Once you have set up the paths, open a new Terminal.app window, and close
all other ones. That's it, you now have a base Fink system installed.

Before you can install additional packages, you will need to download their
descriptions. To do this, in your new Terminal.app window, ether use:

   [frodo:~] testuser% fink selfupdate-rsync
   Password: (your normal password here)
   Please note: the simple command 'fink selfupdate' should be used for routine
   updating; you only need to use a command like 'fink selfupdate-cvs' or 'fink
   selfupdate --method=rsync' if you are changing your update method.
   ...
   (wait for the downloads to finish)

 (preferred) or

   [frodo:~] testuser% fink selfupdate-cvs
   Password: (your normal password here)
   
   Please note: the simple command 'fink selfupdate' should be used for routine
   updating; you only need to use a command like 'fink selfupdate-cvs' or 'fink
   selfupdate --method=rsync' if you are changing your update method. 
   
   fink is setting your default update method to cvs
   
   Fink has the capability to run the CVS commands as a normal user. That has some
   advantages - it uses that user's CVS settings files and allows the package
   descriptions to be edited and updated without becoming root. Please specify the
   user login name that should be used: [<your username>] (press return)
   
   For Fink developers only: Enter your SourceForge login name to set up full CVS
   access. Other users, just press return to set up anonymous read-only access.
   [anonymous] (press return)
   
   Checking to see if we can use hard links to merge the existing tree. Please
   ignore errors on the next few lines.
   Now logging into the CVS server. When CVS asks you for a password, just press
   return (i.e. the password is empty).
   /usr/bin/su hansen -c 'cvs -d":pserver:anonymous@fink.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fink" login'
   Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@fink.cvs.sourceforge.net:2401/cvsroot/fink
   CVS password: (press return)
   Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@fink.cvs.sourceforge.net:2401/cvsroot/fink
   ...
   (wait for the downloads to finish)

especially if you are using a proxy.

If you are using Xcode 4.3 or later, you should also run

   
   sudo xcodebuild -license

and enter agree so that Fink's unprivileged user can build packages that
need more than just the basic tools.

You can now install packages with the "fink" command, like this:

   [frodo:~] testuser% fink install gimp2
   Password:
   Scanning package description files..........
   Information about 6230 packages read in 1 seconds.
   
   fink needs help picking an alternative to satisfy a virtual dependency. The
   candidates:

If these instructions don't work for you, well, you'll have to take the time
to read through the rest of this document and the online FAQ [http://www.finkproject.org/faq/]. You
can also ask on the fink-users mailing list [http://www.finkproject.org/lists/fink-users.php], but
expect to be pointed back at the documentation when your problem actually is
well-documented.


 First Time Installation
=========================

 Requirements
--------------
You need:

 * An installed Mac OS X system, version 10.7 or later.

 * The Xcode Command Line Tools are mandatory. This package can be installed
   either by downloading it directly via developer.apple.com, through the
   Xcode application, on via the Components page of the Downloads tab of the
   Preferences on 10.7 and 10.8, or on 10.9 and 10.10 by running the

      xcode-select --install

   command and choosing the Install button in the window that pops up, or
   you can install the full Xcode if you prefer. You may also need to use
   this command to update the tools, especially if you're having build
   problems.

   If you're doing a manual download, make sure that the tools you install
   match your Mac OS X version as well as your Xcode app version (if that is
   present).

 * Java. Entering

      javac

   from a Terminal.app window should suffice to make the system download it
   for you.

 * Many other things that come with Mac OS X and the Developer Tools. This
   includes perl and curl.

 * Internet access. All source code is downloaded from mirror sites.

 * Patience. Compiling several big packages takes time. I'm talking hours or
   even days here.


 Choosing A Directory
----------------------
Before you install, you must decide where Fink's directory hierarchy will
live. The recommended place is /sw, and all examples in this document will
use that. Any other directory should be fine as well, as long as you don't
use existing directories like /usr/local or /usr. The bootstrap script tries
to catch these.

The directory that you choose must not contain any spaces or similar
characters. Both Unix itself and the bulk of Unix software were written
under this assumption. Using symlinks to trick the bootstrap script simply
won't work.


 Installation
--------------
First, you need to unpack the fink-0.38.3.tar.gz tarball (it might also show
up as "fink-0.38.3.tar" if you used Safari to download it). So, in a
terminal window, go to the directory where you put the tarball, and run this
command:

   tar xf fink-0.38.3.tar.gz

You now have a directory named fink-0.38.3. Change to it with "cd
fink-0.38.3" .

The actual installation is performed by the perl script bootstrap. So, to
start installation, go to the fink-0.38.3 directory and run this command:

   ./bootstrap

After running some tests, the script will ask you what method should be used
to gain root privileges. The most useful choice is 'sudo'. On a default
install of Mac OS X, sudo is already enabled for the user account created
during installation. The script will immediately use the method you choose
to become root. This is required for the installation.

Next, the script will ask you for the installation path. See 'Choosing A
Directory' above for hints about this. The script will create the directory
and set it up for the bootstrap that will be done later.

Next up is Fink configuration. The process should be self-explaining. You
will be asked how you want to set up fink's build user account. If you are
on a networked system where the users and groups are on a central server,
you can select the parameters manually--check with your network
administrator as to what to use. You will also be asked about
proxies--again, check with your network administrator, and to select mirror
sites for downloads. If you don't know what to say, you can just press
Return and Fink will use a reasonable default value.

Finally, the script has enough information to conduct the bootstrap process.
That means it will now download, build and install some essential packages.
Don't worry if you see some packages apparently being compiled twice. This
is required because to build a binary package of the package manager, you
first must have the package manager available.

Note: on 10.8, 10.9, and 10.10, after you start the install process you may
see dialog windows asking whether you want to install XQuartz. If you want
to do so, go ahead. You won't have to stop the Fink install to do that.

After the bootstrap procedure finishes, run "/sw/bin/pathsetup.sh" to help
set up your shell environment for use with Fink. In most cases, it will run
automatically, and prompt you for permission to make changes. If the script
fails, you'll have to do things by hand (see below).

(If you need to do things by hand, and you are using csh or tcsh, you need
to make sure that the command "source /sw/bin/init.csh" is executed during
startup of your shell, either by .login, .cshrc, .tcshrc, or something else
appropriate. If you are using bash or similar shells, the command you need
is ". /sw/bin/init.sh" , and places where it might get executed include
.bashrc and .profile.)

Once your environment is set up, start a new terminal window to ensure that
the changes get implemented. You will now need to have Fink download package
descriptions for you.

You can use

   fink selfupdate-rsync

to download package descriptions using rsync. This is the preferred option
for most users, since it is quick and there are multiple mirror sites
available.

However, rsync is often blocked by network administrators. If your firewall
doesn't allow you to use rsync, then you can try

   fink selfupdate-cvs

to download package descriptions using cvs. If you have an HTTP proxy set
up, fink will pass its information along to cvs. Note: you can only use
anonymous cvs (pserver) through a proxy.

If you are using Xcode 4.3 or later, you should also run

   
   sudo xcodebuild -license

and enter agree so that Fink's unprivileged user can build packages that
need more than just the basic tools.

You can now use "fink" commands to install packages.

   fink --help

is a useful place to get more information about how to use "fink" .


 Getting X11 Sorted Out
------------------------
Fink uses virtual packages to declare dependencies on X11. As of OS 10.6, we
don't provide any packages of our own. The supported options are:

 * 10.7: Only Apple's standard X11.

 * 10.8: Only XQuartz 2.7.2 and later.

 * 10.9: Only XQuartz 2.7.4 and later.

 * 10.9: Only XQuartz 2.7.7 and later.

For more information on installing and running X11, refer to the online X11
on Darwin and Mac OS X document [http://www.finkproject.org/doc/x11/].


 Upgrading Fink
================

You can update Fink with the built-in 'selfupdate' command. Note: this is
not guaranteed to be sufficient if you updated OS X.


 Updating The Package Manager
------------------------------
To update Fink, run the following command:

   fink selfupdate

This will automatically update your existing Fink installation to use the
latest package manager, and also update all essential packages. However, it
will not update any other packages.


 Updating Packages
-------------------
The above updating steps will not update the actual packages, they only
provide you with the means to do so. The easiest way to get the new packages
is to use the 'update-all' command:

   fink update-all

This will bring all installed packages to the latest version. If you don't
want to do this (it may take some time), you can update individual packages
with the 'update' command.


 Clean Upgrade
===============

 There are situations, which normally don't come up every day, in which you
may find that you need to install Fink over again.


 Situations Calling for a Clean Reinstall
------------------------------------------
 * You want to move Fink to a different path.

 * You want to update, or have already updated, OS X between versions where
   Fink doesn't support an upgrade path:

   - 10.4 -> 10.6+

   - 10.5 -> 10.7+

   - 10.6 -> 10.7+

   - 10.8- -> 10.9+

 * Your Fink installation has linked to libraries, e.g. from MacPorts or
   "/usr/local" , which have been removed from your machine thereby breaking
   some of your Fink libraries and executables.


 Backing up to save time
-------------------------
To save time after you have reinstalled Fink, you can get a transcript of
your installed packages. The following command in a terminal window will
work, even if for some reason the Fink tools aren't functioning:

   grep -B1 "install ok installed" /sw/var/lib/dpkg/status \
   | grep "^Package:" | cut -d: -f2 | cut -d\  -f2 > finkinst.txt

This will save the list of your packages in the file "finkinst.txt" in the
current working directory.

You may also want to copy or move the sources in "/sw/src" to another
location so that you don't have to spend time downloading them when you
begin restoring your Fink distribution.

In addition, if you have made global configuration changes to any of your
packages by editing configuration files in "/sw/etc" , then you may wish to
back those up.


 Removing Your Old Fink
------------------------
Once you've backed everything up, you are ready to remove your Fink
distribution. You can remove "/sw" as well as anything in
"/Applications/Fink" using the Finder or the command line:

   sudo rm -rf /sw /Applications/Fink/*

(Replace "/sw" by your actual Fink tree).


 Installing Fink Again
-----------------------
First, follow the first-time install instructions.

 Once you have downloaded package descriptions, you can put the sources that
you backed up into "/sw/src" either using the Finder or the command line:

   sudo cp /path/to/backup/* /sw/src

 (As usual, replace "/sw" with your Fink tree). If you prefer, you can use
"fink configure" to specify your backup location:

   In what additional directory should Fink look for downloaded tarballs? [] 
   (enter your backup directory at the prompt). 

 Note: this requires that the entire path to and including your backup
directory is world-readable.

 You can also restore your global configuration files at this time. Note: we
recommend that you not restore "/sw/etc/fink.conf" from your prior
installation of Fink, to avoid incompatibilities. You can open it up in a
text editor and enter the correponding values into "fink configure" .
