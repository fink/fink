Description: The Debian package manager
DescDetail: <<
This package provides the low-level infrastructure for handling the
installation and removal of Debian software packages.
.
For Debian package development tools, install dpkg-dev.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
In may of 2010, version 1.10.21 which had been used by Fink since 2002, was
bumped to 1.15.5.6. Between those versions, some files were removed and some
were added. For example, 822-date, md5sum and cleanup-info were removed from
the package, and dpkg-trigger, dpkg-vendor and dpkg-gensymbols were removed.

Because 'md5sum' is often used and no longer available, this package adds
an md5sum tool in the patch. This tool, written in Perl and using the standard
Perl on OSX, does not have any dependencies apart from the 'md5' executable
installed on every OS X system.
<<
DescPort: <<
1.10.9 
- Removed --without-zlib flag
- Gets confused about top_srcdir without the --srcdir arg.
- Fixed bug with BR manpage
- Patched update-rc.d out of the app check code, not needed on OS X.

Pre-Jaguar: Needed fixes to use the right architecture, disable code that uses
unimplemented functions on Darwin and other stuff.

Added code to support the pseudo package 'macosx' and 'darwin'.

Fix to install-info script to prevent a certain problem with section titles.

Patched to run 'fink-virtual-pkgs' to see what packages we have outside of $prefix.

Patched to suppress warning about BuildDependsOnly control field.

Previous versions by Christoph Pfisterer.

Patched to not remove Darwin's system-critical symlinks (/etc /tmp /var)

Patched to hardcode complete paths to our component executables
instead of relying on PATH

Patch 'dpkg -b' tar invocation to avoid warning under tar>=1.16
See: http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.core/1281

Patch 'dpkg -b' tar invocation to not die if tar returns exit code 1.  
(Exit 1 is a non-fatal error for tar; exit 2 is fatal.)  patch written by vasi

Fink's make-3.81-1 breaks compiling so use Apple's to be safe.

The on-board getopt needs tweaking for darwin, but isn't needed at all
because libSystem has what dpkg needs, so just scrap it.

Remove un/misused variable in dpkg enquiry.c (solve bus error in --architecture)

Filesystem may be case-insensitive, so do case-insensitive check for
"dpkg -i" replacing files in an already-installed other package

1.15.5.6 adds a new 'md5sum' tool, see DescPackaging for more information.
Also the COPYING filename was updated to point to a Fink path, so
'dpkg --license' works correctly.

PERL5LIB is now set correctly in finkinit, because scripts may need to find
%p/lib/perl5 for Dpkg.pm.

A wrapper for setenv was added to src/help.c because of a crash I saw earlier.
Some investigation turned out that setenv(x, 0, y) crashes on my Snow Leopard
system, while on Linux it doesn't. The wrapper checks if 'name' or 'value'
are zero, and return 0 if they are, preventing the crash.
