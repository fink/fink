Description: Archiving program for files and tape
DescPackaging: <<
 With the current fink dependency engine, essential packages may neither
 depend nor builddepend on non-essential packages.  Thus, to make sure
 that non-essential splitoffs of essential packages (like gettext-bin
 and *-dev) are present at build time, we call 'fink install' during
 the compile script.  Note that since the corresponding essential packages
 are dependencies of this one, they should already have been built, so
 'fink install' should merely make sure they are in place.
 
 Due to the need to run 'fink install' within CompileScript, tar can't
 be built with --build-as-nobody.

 One of the ./configure checks doesn't work when done as root;
 FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE ignores that test-result.
