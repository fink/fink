Description: LZMA file compressor
DescDetail: <<
    LZMA is a general purporse compression algorithm designed by
    Igor Pavlov as part of 7-Zip. It provides high compression ratio
    while keeping the decompression speed fast.

    XZ Utils are an attempt to make LZMA compression easy to use
    on free (as in freedom) operating systems. This is achieved by
    providing tools and libraries which are similar to use than the
    equivalents of the most popular existing compression algorithms.

    XZ Utils consist of a few relatively separate parts:
      * liblzma is an encoder/decoder library with support for several
        filters (algorithm implementations). The primary filter is LZMA.
      * libzfile (or whatever the name will be) enables reading from and
        writing to gzip, bzip2 and LZMA compressed and uncompressed files
        with an API similar to the standard ANSI-C file I/O.
        [ NOTE: libzfile is not implemented yet. ]
      * xz command line tool has almost identical syntax than gzip
        and bzip2. It makes LZMA easy for average users, but also
        provides advanced options to finetune the compression settings.
      * A few shell scripts make diffing and grepping LZMA compressed
        files easy. The scripts were adapted from gzip and bzip2.

DescUsage: <<
	Use the xz, xzdec and unxz commands to process .xz files.
	Use the lzma, lzmadec and unlzma commands to process .lzma files.
	The .xz format is newer and is meant to replace .lzma.
	Additional scripts: lzdiff, lzcmp, lzgrep, lzegrep, lzfgrep,
	lzmore, lzless, lzcat, xzcat
