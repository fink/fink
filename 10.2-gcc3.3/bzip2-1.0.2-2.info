Description: Block-sorting file compressor
DescDetail: <<
bzip2 is a portable, lossless data compressor based on the
Burrows-Wheeler transform. It achieves good compression and runs on
practically every (32/64-bit) platform in the known universe.
<<
DescPort: <<
Doesn't use autoconf, but comes with a useful Makefile. Anyway, the
patch modifies it to build a shared library instead of a static one.
