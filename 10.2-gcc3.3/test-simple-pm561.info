Description: Basic utilities for writing tests
DescDetail: <<
  This is an extremely simple, extremely basic module for writing tests
  suitable for CPAN modules and other pursuits.  If you wish to do more
  complicated testing, use the Test::More module (a drop-in replacement
  for this one).
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 test-simple-pm560 and test-simple-pm561 are needed in 10.2-gcc3.3 and 
earlier so that the fink test suite can be run as fink is being compiled.
To avoid problems with updating, Info2 is not used for those two packages
(in any tree).
