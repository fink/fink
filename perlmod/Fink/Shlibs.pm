=head1 NAME

Fink::Shlibs - Find dependencies based on shared libs.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Get the dependencies for the files to be installed
  my @deps = Fink::Shlibs->get_shlibs $pkgname, @files;

  # Invalidate the current internal cache of shlibs when dpkg changes
  Fink::Shlibs->invalidate;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Most of the dependencies needed for a package to be installed are simply to
supply the shared libraries which it links to. Because each package which
supplies a shared library lists it in the 'Shlibs' field, these dependencies
can be determined automatically.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item get_shlibs

  my @depspecs = Fink::Shlibs->get_shlibs $pv, @files;

Get the dependency specifications needed to supply the shared libs linked to
by the given files.

Pass in the PkgVersion object for which we are getting the depends, and
the list of files which should be checked.

A dependency specification is a package name and a version specification,
eg: 'foo (>= 1.0-1)'.

=cut

sub get_shlibs {
	my ($class, $pv, @filelist) = @_;

	my @depends = $class->_check_files($pv, @filelist);
	
	my %found; # don't duplicate
	foreach my $depend (@depends) {
		if (length($depend) > 1) {
			$found{$depend} = 1;
		}
	}

	return sort keys %found;
}

=item invalidate

  Fink::Shlibs->invalidate;

When the state of dpkg changes (ie: when a package is installed or removed),
the cache of installed shlibs needs to be regenerated. This function notifies
Shlibs when this is the case.

sub invalidate {
	$shlibs = undef;

  my @depspecs = Fink::Shlibs->_check_files $pv, @filelist;

Similar to get_shlibs, but unchecked output, so depspecs may be empty or
duplicate.

	# multiple times.  We need to consider <package>,<operator> as a

	# recreating it later.
