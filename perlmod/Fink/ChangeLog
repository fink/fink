2002-10-14  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm: Rewrote parts of real_install to hopefully make it cleaner,
	  easier to understand, and less buggy when it comes to splitoffs.

2002-10-12 Dave Morrison <dmrrsn@users.sourceforge.net>

	* PkgVersion.pm: When a Shlibs field is present, write its contents 
	into DEBIAN/shlibs when building the deb

	* Validation.pm: Added Shlibs field
	
2002-10-10  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Validation.pm: Added RunTimeVars field; warn if description ends with "."

2002-10-04  Benjamin Reed <rangerrick@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Engine.pm: Another small patch to the splitoff code.  This patch
	  changes the checking for flags (reinstall, rebuild, etc.) to match
	  the code used for installing the primary package, and it makes
	  sure that the parent splitoff is the last one installed on the
	  dpkg command-line to fix goofy dpkg ordering issues.

2002-09-28  Ben Hines <bhines@alumni.ucsd.edu>

	* PkgVersion.pm, NetAccess.pm: Patch 612681: Allow "continue" 
	  for bad MD5 during "fink install... "

	* PkgVersion.pm: Fix Axel problem with partial downloads

	* PkgVersion.pm: Change some tarballs to "file"s

2002-09-28  Benjamin Reed <rangerrick@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Engine.pm: small patch to fix 'fink rebuild' and possibly some other
	  buglets that could sneak through.  If a package has splitoffs, it was
	  sometimes getting marked as "already activated" even if it was set to
	  be explicitly reinstalled.

2002-09-25  Benjamin Reed <rangerrick@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Engine.pm: fixed so that the rest of a splitoff doesn't get
	  reinstalled if just one package from the splitoff is being installed

	* PkgVersion.pm: fixes the get_fullname bug when a dependency
	  doesn't exist

	* PkgVersion.pm: moved the code that checks for existing versions
	  in the package tree when resolving dependencies -- in some cases
	  it could die because a package that wasn't supposed to exist was
	  getting marked as being there

2002-09-25  Ben Hines <bhines@alumni.ucsd.edu>

	* PkgVersion.pm: Patch #614133: fix gnome mirror

2002-09-19  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm, Package.pm, PkgVersion.pm: Patch #610249: fix for the 'node 
	  exists' bug (bug #60016)

2002-09-08  Dave Morrison <dmrrsn@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Config.pm: adds $distribution (read from the config file) as
	  an exported item

	* SelfUpdate.pm: now checks out the "dists" CVS module rather
	  than the "packages" one (still as the "fink" directory).  
	  This contains a "10.2" subdirectory.  Users using 10.1 also 
	  get a second checkout: "packages/dists" is checked out as 
	  "fink/10.1".

	* Validation.pm: added the new "gcc" field
	
2002-08-21  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm: Fixed "fink remove" command

2002-08-19  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm, PkgVersion.pm: Changed the data path for "fink remove" a bit

	* Engine.pm, PkgVersion.pm: Patch #596239 (fink splitoff install changes)
	  incorporated, improves splitoff handling

	* Validation.pm: Added JarFiles and TarFilesRename fields.

2002-08-11  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm: Enhanced how the Files field (in splitoffs) is handled:
	  if the given path starts with a slash, we treat it as relative to %d/%D
	  otherwise as relative to %i/%I (as we do currently anyway).
	
	* Services.pm: Fix for bug #545155 (it was possible to cause infinite
	  recursion during percent expansion).

2002-08-10  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* SelfUpdate.pm: Only force a second rebuild of the package database, and 
	  also only restart Fink if the package manager is being updated.

2002-08-05  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (cmd_cleanup): Improved the "fink cleanup" command to also clean
	  files in /sw/src (only files not directories - removing directories in 
	  /sw/src is dangerous as it can interupt running builds etc.)

	* Mirror.pm: Don't use mirror timestamp as a mirror (Bug #563182).

2002-08-04  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Config.pm, Configure.pm: Fixed verbosity level selection.

	* PkgVersion.pm: Patch #588476 (Java support) by Sylvain Cuaz.

	* Fixed bug #548373 (package DB read thrice). It is not only read twice
	  (the new package manager may support new features, and thus must rebuild
	  the database once more)

	* Engine.pm: Patch #588705: Automates passing on the options
	  (by Sylvain Cuaz)

2002-08-03  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Services.pm: Fixed read_properties_multival, it was broken by the
	  RuntimeVars patch.

	* PkgVersion.pm, Services.pm: Patch #579210: RuntimeVars field added
	  (thanks to Sylvain Cuaz for this)

2002-07-31  Justin F. Hallett  <thesin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Small fix to Configure.pm for the verbosity level selection,
	  which was reported not working. Should be fine now.

2002-07-28  Justin F. Hallett  <thesin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added /sbin and /usr/sbin to the clean env since some pkgs need
	  stuff like chown or chmod to install properly.

2002-07-26  Justin F. Hallett  <thesin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Changed spacing in fink list easier to use with awk or cut
	* added a space before pkg list for better seperation of info

2002-07-26  Justin F. Hallett  <thesin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Services.pm: Fix for the Jag Argument "M-?M-^?M-X" isn't numeric
	  in numeric eq (==) at /sw/lib/perl5/Fink/Engine.pm line 330, <SW_VERS>
	  line 2. Bug.  But COLUMNS needs to bet exported in init.{csh, sh}

2002-07-25  Justin F. Hallett  <thesin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Services.pm: Temp Fix for the Jag Argument "M-?M-^?M-X" isn't numeric
	  in numeric eq (==) at /sw/lib/perl5/Fink/Engine.pm line 330, <SW_VERS>
	  line 2. Bug.  Need better fix in future, maybe read $ENV{COLUMNS}

2002-07-25  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>
	
	* PkgVersion.pm: Fixed Bootstrap (use /usr/bin/gnutar if %p/bin/tar is missing)

	* Engine.pm: Little fix that ensures Fink runs even if not on a terminal.
	
2002-07-24  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Incorporated patch #504498 by Justin F. Hallett which adds the
	  TarFilesRename and TarNFilesRename field.

	* Incorporated patch #577882 by Sylvain Cuaz which cleans the environment 
	before building packages.

2002-07-22  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Various files: Applied Justin's multi-level verbosity patch.

2002-07-06  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Package.pm (scan_all, update_db): Fixed index'ing bug.

2002-06-09  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (cmd_cleanup): Added a "fink cleanup" command, still unfinished,
	but already usable to clean up .deb files.

2002-06-08  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Bootstrap.pm (bootstrap): Added apt-shlibs to the list of packages that are
	automatically installed during bootstrap.
	
	* Engine.pm (cmd_scanpackages): Made apt-shlibs an "important" package.

	* Package.pm: Implemented use_cache flag - can later be used to add an
	option to turn off the package cacher temporarily.
	
	* SelfUpdate.pm (finish): Include apt-shlibs in the list of packags that are
	updated upon a selfupdate.

2002-05-28  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Services.pm (file_MD5_checksum): Fixed bug caused by certain special
	characters occuring in filenames passed to this function.

2002-05-28  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (phase_patch, phase_compile, phase_install): Now use the new
	run_script method; single-shell scripts are now actually usable inside
	InstallScript and PatchScript.

	* PkgVersion.pm: New method run_script that encapsulates running a script.

2002-05-27  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Validation.pm: Accept Source-MD5/SourceN-MD5 as legal fields.

2002-05-26  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (do_real_list): Fixed bug that occured when output of 'fink list'
	was not going to a terminal and --width=auto was specified.

2002-05-25  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm: Added Source-MD5/SourceN-MD5 fields.

	* Services.pm: Added file_MD5_checksum function.

	* PkgVersion.pm: Make use of the new execute_script function.

	* Services.pm: Added execute_script function (based on patch #534121 by
	Benjamin Reed).

2002-05-25  Alexander Strange <MrVacBob@mac.com>

	* SelfUpdate.pm (setup_direct_cvs): The hardlink-support test works now.

2002-05-23  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (real_install): Under certain condition, splitoffs could have 
	been activated more than once. This problem fixes this.

2002-05-16  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (real_install): Fixed 'fink rebuild' to honor BuildDepends.

2002-05-16  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Bootstrap.pm (bootstrap): Fixed bootstraping (YASB).

2002-05-11  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (cmd_scanpackages): Fixed very stupid bug.

	* Validation.pm (validate_info_file): missing description field now is an
	error instead of a warning.

2002-05-05  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (enable_bootstrap, disable_bootstrap): fixed for splitoffs
	(thanks to Sylvain Cuaz for this patch).

2002-05-04  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* SelfUpdate.pm (do_tarball): Replaced prdownloads URL with mirror 'sourceforge'.

2002-05-02  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (resolve_depends): Fixed bug that made building splitoffs that 
	depend on their master impossible (affects kdebase package).

2002-05-01  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (get_description): Don't display DescPort and DescPackaging,
	they are unimportant for the avarage user and developers must look at the
	.info file anyway.

2002-04-25  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (real_install): Fixed bug #546315

2002-04-19  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Bootstrap.pm, Engine.pm, SelfUpdate.pm: Made storable-pm an "important"
	package like apt, i.e it will be installed during bootstrap and updated on
	on selfupdate.

2002-04-15  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* all: updated copyright notice.

2002-03-31  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Package.pm: Now works again if the Storable perl module is not installed.

2002-03-31  Finlay Dobbie <finlayd@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Package.pm: Added support for caching of info files.
	
	* Engine.pm: Added an index command to update the cache.
	
	* SelfUpdate.pm (do_finish): added hook to update package cache.
	
2002-03-26  Justin F. Hallett <thesin@southofheaven.net>

	* PkgVersion.pm: Fixed Type: perl to install the execs into
	the proper dir and not directly into BASEPATH.

2002-03-21  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm: added get_tree function
	
	* NetAccess.pm (download_cmd): Added another download method, "axel"
	(thanks to Alexander Strange)

2002-03-19  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Config.pm (initialize): No macosx pseudo package if we are not on
	Mac OS X!

	* Status.pm (initialize): Fixed macosx version detection on Darwin
	(obviously there is no Mac OS X version on a pure Darwin system)

2002-03-16  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>
	
	* PkgVersion.pm (resolve_depends): Yet another attempt to fix splitoff
	build dependencies, hopefully more succesful this time.

2002-03-16 Dave Morrison <dmrrsn@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Validation.pm: Added "SplitOff" to the list of known fields, and 
	parsing for SplitOff2-SplitOff9

	* Engine.pm: When fink prompts users for a decision about a
	dependency, it now displays the Descriptions of the packages involved
	in the decision.

2002-03-16  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>
	
	* Validation.pm: Added "BuildDependsOnly" to the list of known fields
	
	* PkgVersion.pm (resolve_depends): Fixed this so that splitoffs and
	splitoff masters always return the same (correct) build dependencies.
	
	* PkgVersion.pm (add_splitoff): Removed annoying debug output ("Found a
	splitoff")
		
	* Services.pm (read_properties_lines): Handle nested heredocs
	correctly, and if errors are encountered, once more output the
	affected filename.

2002-03-13  Peter O'Gorman <ogorman@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Engine.pm (do_real_list): Don't read package info first, wait and
	see if it is needed. Fixed a mistake in the help text.

2002-03-13  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (phase_build): Fix so that root-dirs of splitoffs are
	properly removed again.

2002-03-13  Peter O'Gorman <ogorman@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Engine.pm: Support for options in apropos and list commands.

	* Services.pm: Added a get_term_width function.

2002-03-09  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (cmd_apropos): Fixed apropos commands for strings like "gtk+"

2002-03-07  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (real_install): Fix to make rebuilding splitoffs and splitoff
	master packages work correctly.

	* PkgVersion.pm (initialize): Expand percents in even more fields now:
	Suggests, Enhances, Recommends and Pre-Depends.
	(expand_percent_if_available): First converts field parameter to lower case.
	(phase_install): Fixed some issues with the Files field, and changed the
	order in which it is processed (now comes before DocFiles, not after)

2002-03-06  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm: Multitude of changes, implementing initial splitoff 
	support. Percent expansion is now done in all dependency related fields.

	* Package.pm (inject_description): Return the created PkgVersion object
	to the called. Used by splitoff code

	* Services.pm (read_properties): Split this function, creating two new
	called read_properties_var and read_properties_lines, which take a text
	variable / a list of strings, instead of a file. Used by splitoff code.

2002-02-23  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* NetAccess.pm (fetch_url_to_file, download_cmd): Allow the user to
	resume partial downloads.
	
	* NetAccess.pm (download_cmd): Added 'DownloadMethod' field to fink.conf
	(thanks to Christian Swinehart).

	* NetAccess.pm (download_cmd): If we use curl, make sure it treats 
	error 404 properly, i.e. fail instead of downloading the error page
	(thanks to Joseph Bauer).

	* Engine.pm (, cmd_fetch_allcmd_fetch_all_missing): keep going even if a
	single file could not be downloaded. (thanks to Randal L. Schwartz). 

2002-02-01  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Validation.pm: deb file validator now warns if files are installed
	outside of /sw.

2002-01-27  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Validation.pm: Warn on unknown licenses.

2002-01-26  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Validation.pm: Many more problems are detected now

	* Engine.pm (restart_as_root): Pass on more options to new instance

	* *.pm: Changed to use new is_verbose() function to determine verbosity
	
	* Config.pm (is_verbose): New function, returns true if verbose mode is on

	* Validation.pm: Only be verbose in verbose mode

	* Validation.pm: Warn on missing license field

2002-01-11  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* FinkVersion.pm.in: If /sw/fink/VERSION is missing, now tries to look
	at the old /sw/etc/fink-release file instead.

2002-01-10  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* FinkVersion.pm.in: moved fink-release from /sw/etc to /sw/fink and
	renamed it to VERSION to match with other modules

	* SelfUpdate.pm: fixed selfupdate, it would hang when trying to
	uncompress the package tar ball.

2002-01-05  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Validation.pm: fixed stupid mistake

	* Validation.pm: Added /sw/lib/locale to list of deprecated directories;
	added some new fields to list of allowed fields (not yet used)

2001-12-28  Matthias Neeracher <neeracher@mac.com>

	* Package.pm: Added %package_hash which speeds up some operations
	enormously.

2001-12-27  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Config.pm: Added $darwin_version and $macosx_version, reflecting
	the kernel/system versions.

	* Status.pm (initialize): Added pseudo packages 'darwin' and 'macosx'
	which can be used for dependencies on specific kernel/system versions.

2001-12-23  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (phase_install): Fixed bug occuring when removing the
	last 'perl' type package using UpdatePOD.

2001-12-21  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm, Package.pm: Allow '+' in package names.

2001-12-20  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* SelfUpdate.pm (do_direct_cvs): Fixed CVS updating for core developers
	(CVS_RSH now always is set to 'ssh').

2001-12-12  Justin F. Hallett  <thesin@southofheaven.net>

	* PkgVersion.pm: Added UpdatePOD field, and added value "Perl" for
	the "type" field to better support perl packages

2001-12-11  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (cmd_remove): All packages to be removed are now passed
	at once to dpkg, thus taking advantage of the advanced dependency
	resolving mechanism of dpkg.

2001-12-02  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm: Added percent expansion for SourceRename fields

2001-11-06  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Engine.pm (process): Get rid of the funky "Done." message.

2001-11-04  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* SelfUpdate.pm (setup_direct_cvs): Made the File::Find routine
	more robust. Should be able to handle exotic file names now.

2001-11-02  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* SelfUpdate.pm: Major rewrite. Now gives the user the choice
	between tracking point releases (the usual packages-#.#.#.tar.gz
	procedure) and setting up direct CVS updating.
	* Engine.pm: Added a selfupdate-cvs command.

2001-11-01  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Mirror.pm (new_from_field): Disabled the case for leaving out
	the key in custom mirror lists; it doesn't work anyway because the
	URLs themselves also contain colons. We'll need another separator.

2001-10-27  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (resolve_depends): Make "package not found"
	non-fatal if there are alternatives.

2001-10-20  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Engine.pm (real_install): Let the user pick one alternative when
	resolving dependencies with virtual packages.

2001-10-18  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Engine.pm (restart_as_root): Propagate the "--yes" option when
	restarting as root.

	* Services.pm (prompt, prompt_boolean, prompt_selection): Check
	the "dontask" a.k.a. "--yes" option and use the default value
	instead of prompting the user when set.

	* Config.pm: Added infrastructure to propagate command line
	options: set_options() and get_option().

	* Engine.pm (process): Be more helpful when the user entered an
	unknown command (contributed by Justin Hallett).

2001-10-17  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Mirror.pm: New class that handles both named and package-local
	mirror site lists. Retrying is handled more intelligently.
	* NetAccess.pm: Another major overhaul. Handling of mirrors has
	been moved to the new Mirror class. That greatly simplified the
	fetch_url_to_file routine.
	* PkgVersion.pm: Use the new Mirror class to handle package-local
	mirrors. The mirror list is parsed on the fly when it is needed.

	* Engine.pm (process): Added a "this command needs root
	privileges" flag. Minor restructuring.
	(restart_as_root): New function which re-executes fink as root,
	passing the current command. Now knows about su if configured.

	* FinkVersion.pm.in: Made independent of Fink::Config. The
	installation path is now hardcoded during installation, like with
	fink.in.

2001-10-14  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Services.pm (version_cmp): Hopefully get it right this
	time. dpkg implicitly separates version and revision before
	comparing them. As a result the change to fink's comparison
	function that should fix openssh's version ordering broke
	openssl's ordering.

2001-10-13  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Services.pm (filename): More general solution to handle mirror:
	URLs that don't contain a slash.

2001-10-10  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Service.pm (filename): Handle fileanames with the mirror: syntax
	correctly (was broken).

	* PkgVersion.pm (initialize): Parse the new CustomMirror field
	(fetch_source): pass the custom mirror list to fetch_url_to_file

	* NetAccess.pm: converted tabs to spaces
	(fetch_url_to_file): some  clean up, now handles "custom" mirrors,
	code that determines the download cmd moved to a seperate function
	so that it will be easier to enhance this.

2001-10-09  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* FinkVersion.pm.in (pkginfo_version): New function to evaluate
	the stamp files for package descriptions.
	* SelfUpdate.pm (check): Use the new pkginfo_version() instead of
	distribution_version(). Stop dead when CVS updating is
	detected. Minor text and code fixes.

	* Services.pm (version_cmp): Changed the version comparison to
	match that of dpkg exactly.

	* SelfUpdate.pm (check): Suppress inject.pl's user info message.

2001-10-07  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (get_tarball): Handle the new SourceRename and
	Source#Rename fields.
	(fetch_source): Use get_tarball and fetch_url_to_file to handle
	on-the-fly renaming. Disabled verbose error messages, failures are
	handled by fetch_url_to_file. Added tries parameter (passed on to
	fetch_url_to_file).
	(phase_unpack): Offer re-downloading when unpacking fails. Let tar
	handle gzip-compressed files to catch more errors (the shell pipe
	apparently only returns the last command's error code).

2001-10-05  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* NetAccess.pm: Major overhaul. New function fetch_url_to_file
	allows a target file name to be specified. fetch_url calls through
	to the new function. mirror: URL's are handled
	transparently. After obvious failures fetch_url_to_file offers the
	user to retry the same server or a randomly chosen mirror.
	* Services.pm (expand_url): Removed mirror expansion code.
	* PkgVersion.pm (fetch_source): Don't use expand_url, this is now
	handled transparently by fetch_url.

2001-10-04  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Engine.pm (cmd_scanpackages): Make sure the directory we're
	scanning does exist.

2001-09-27  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (phase_patch): New fields UpdateConfigGuessInDirs
	and UpdateLibtoolInDirs to copy the replacement files directly
	into a list of subdirectories.

2001-09-21  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (phase_install): Create a small README for bundle
	packages - dpkg doesn't like empty packages.

2001-09-17  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm: More protection against unexpected white space.

	* Services.pm (collapse_space): New function to collapse all white
