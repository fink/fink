=head1 NAME

Fink::SelfUpdate::Base - base class for selfupdate-method classes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each method of selfupdating will soon be encapsulated in a
Fink::SelfUpdate::$method class, which are subclasses of the
Fink::SelfUpdate::Base class. There are stub methods for the public
interface calls, so a $method class only needs to override as needed.
All calls are class methods at this time.

=over 4

=item description

	my $label = Fink::SelfUpdate::$method->description();

Returns a short description of this method, similar to the Description
field of a package. Defaults to the package-name (no leading classes)
as lower-case.

=cut

sub description {
	require Fink::SelfUpdate;
	&Fink::SelfUpdate::class2methodname($_[0]);
}

=item system_check

	my $boolean = Fink::SelfUpdate::$method->system_check();

Determine whether this method can be used on this machine. Make sure
needed external executables are present, etc. Must be over-ridden.

=cut

sub system_check { warn "Not implemented\n"; return 0; }

=item devtools_check

	my $boolean = Fink::SelfUpdate::$method->devtools_check($vcs, $vcs_exec);

Common test for all selfupdate methods.

If the "dev-tools" virtual package doesn't exist, or if the executable referenced by
$vcs_executable isn't executable (typically this means not installed), devtools_check()
returns 0 and prints an OS-versioned warning about what Xcodes to install and where to get
them.

=cut

sub devtools_check {
	my $vcs_exec = pop; # comes in as $_[2];
	my $vcs = pop;
	my ($line2,$line4)=("","");
	my $osxversion=Fink::VirtPackage->query_package("macosx");
	# OS X versioned text.
	if (&version_cmp ("$osxversion", "<<", "10.6")) {
		$line2="\nXcode, available on your original OS X install disk, or from ";
	} elsif (&version_cmp ("$osxversion", "<<", "10.7")) {
		$line2="\nXcode, available on your original OS X install disk, from the App Store, or from\n" ;
	} elsif (&version_cmp ("$osxversion", "<<", "10.8")) {
		$line2 = ":\n* Xcode 4.1.x or Xcode 4.2.x from the App store or from\n";
		$line4 = "\n* or the Xcode Command Line Tools package,\n".
				 "which is available from connect.apple.com\n".
				 "or via the Downloads tab of the Preferences in Xcode 4.3 and later";
	} else {
		$line2 = "\nthe Xcode Command Line Tools package from\n";
		$line4 = ",\nor via the Downloads tab of the Xcode Preferences";
	}
	unless (-f $vcs_exec and -x $vcs_exec  and Fink::VirtPackage->query_package("dev-tools")) {
		warn "Before changing your selfupdate method to '$vcs', you must install".
		     $line2.
		     "http://connect.apple.com (after free registration)".
		     $line4.".\n";
		return 0;
	}
	return 1;
}

=item clear_metadata

  Fink::SelfUpdate::$method->clear_metadata();

Remove all metadata files and other structures related to this
selfupdate class (example: CVS/ directories).

=cut

sub clear_metadata {}

=item do_direct

	my $data = Fink::SelfUpdate::$method->do_direct();

This implements the actual selfupdate sync process. Must be
over-ridden (obviously). Returns boolean indicating success. Must call
Fink::SelfUpdate::$method->do_direct before returning.

=cut

sub do_direct { die "Not implemented\n" }

=item update_version_file

	Fink::SelfUpdate::$method->update_version_file(%options);

Records information in %p/fink/$distribution/VERSION.selfupdate about
the just-done selfupdate. Returns nothing useful. Probably safest to
avoid overriding this class method. The following %options are known:

=over 4

=item distribution (optional)

Updates the VERSION file for the given value. Defaults to the
currently active distribution.

=item data (optional)

A single line of text containing method-specific information
(point-update version number, remote server info, etc).

=back

=cut

sub update_version_file {
	my $class = shift;
	my %options = ('distribution' => $distribution, 'data' => '', @_);

	my $filename = "$basepath/fink/$options{distribution}/VERSION.selfupdate";
	my @lines = ();

	# read old file
	if (open my $FH, '<', $filename) {
		@lines = <$FH>;
		close $FH;
	}
	chomp @lines;

	# remove old selfupdate info
	@lines = grep { $_ !~ /^\s*SelfUpdate\s*:/i } @lines;

	# add new selfupdate info
	require Fink::SelfUpdate;
	my $line = sprintf 'SelfUpdate: %s@%s', Fink::SelfUpdate::class2methodname($class), time();
	$line .= " $options{data}" if length $options{data};
	push @lines, $line;

	# save new file contents atomically
	if (open my $FH, '>', "$filename.tmp") {
		print $FH map "$_\n", @lines;
		close $FH;
		unlink $filename;
		rename "$filename.tmp", $filename;
	} else {
		print_breaking_stderr "WARNING: Not saving timestamp of selfupdate because could not write $filename.tmp: $!\n";
	}
