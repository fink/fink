<p>
This section is for the impatient who don't want to take the time to
learn their way around the command line world and don't care that they
don't know what they're actually doing.
</p>
<p>
If you're looking for the real instructions, skip to the <a href="#install-first">next section</a>.
(You can still use this section as an example.)
</p>


<h3><a name="install-fast.req">1.1 Requirements</a></h3>
<p>
You need:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
An installed Mac OS X system, version 10.9 or later.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The Xcode Command Line Tools are mandatory. This package can be installed either by 
downloading it directly via developer.apple.com, or by running the</p>
<pre>xcode-select --install</pre>
<p>command and choosing the   
<b>Install</b> button in the window that pops up.
You may also need to use this command to update the tools,
especially if you're having build problems.</p>
<p>If you're doing a manual download, make sure that the tools you install match your
OS X version as well as your Xcode app version (if that is present).</p>
<p>You will need to accept the Xcode license as root.  To do that, run</p>
<pre>sudo xcodebuild -license</pre>
<p>then scroll to the bottom of the text and type</p>
<pre>agree</pre>
<p>Some packages require the full Xcode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Java.  Entering</p>
<pre>javac</pre>
<p>from a Terminal.app window should suffice to make the system download it for you.</p></li>
<li><p>
Many other things that come with Mac OS X.
This includes perl and curl.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Internet access.
All source code is downloaded from mirror sites.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Patience.
Compiling several big packages takes time.
I'm talking hours or even days here.
</p></li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="install-fast.scripted-install">1.2 First Time Installation Very Fast
Track</a></h3>
<p>
Download the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fink/scripts/master/srcinstaller/Install%20Fink.tool">
Install Fink.tool</a> script and double-click on it.  This will automate the downloads
in the steps below.
</p>
<p>
The script may have to stop for you to do something.  If so, run it again.
</p>

<h3><a name="install-fast.install">1.3 First Time Installation Fast
Track</a></h3>
<p>
Start out by copying the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink-0.39.3.tar.gz</tt>
file to your home folder (it might also show up as <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink-0.39.3.tar</tt> if you
used Safari to download it).
Then, open Terminal.app and follow the session below.
Computer output is in <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">normal face</tt>, your input is in
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;"><b>bold face</b></tt> (or otherwise highlighted).
The actual input prompts from the shell may vary, and some chunks of
the output have been omitted (<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">...</tt>).
</p>
<p>Note:  after you start the install process you may see
dialog windows asking whether you want to install XQuartz.
If you want to do so, go ahead.  You won't have to stop the Fink install
to do that.</p>
<pre>[frodo:~] testuser% <b>tar xf fink-0.39.3.tar.gz</b>
[frodo:~] testuser% <b>cd fink-0.39.3</b>
[frodo:~/fink-0.39.3] testuser% <b>./bootstrap</b>

Fink must be installed and run with superuser (root) privileges
...
Choose a method: [1] <b>1</b>

sudo /Users/testuser/fink-0.39.3/bootstrap .sudo '/sw'
Password: <b>(your normal password here)</b>
...
OK, I'll ask you some questions and update the configuration file in
'/sw/etc/fink.conf'.

In what additional directory should Fink look for downloaded tarballs? [] <b>(press return)</b>

Which directory should Fink use to build packages? (If you don't know what this
means, it is safe to leave it at its default.) [] <b>(press return)</b>

"Fink can set the UID and GID of its build user dynamically...
...Allow Fink to set the UID/GID dynamically? [Y] <b>(press return)</b>

(1)	Quiet (do not show download statistics)
(2)	Low (do not show tarballs being expanded)
(3)	Medium (will show almost everything)
(4)	High (will show everything)

How verbose should Fink be? [2] <b>(press return)</b>

Proxy/Firewall settings
Enter the URL of the HTTP proxy to use, or 'none' for no proxy. The URL
should start with http:// and may contain username, password or port
specifications. [none] <b>(press return)</b>
Enter the URL of the proxy to use for FTP, or 'none' for no proxy. The URL
should start with http:// and may contain username, password or port
specifications. [none] <b>(press return)</b>
Use passive mode FTP transfers (to get through a firewall)? [Y/n] <b>(press return)</b>

Enter the maximum number of simultaneous build jobs.
...
Maximum number of simultaneous build jobs: [&lt;number of cpus&gt;] <b>(press return)</b>

Mirror selection
Choose a continent:
...
<b>(enter the numbers corresponding to your location)</b>
...
Writing updated configuration to '/sw/etc/fink.conf'...
Bootstrapping a base system via /sw/bootstrap.
...
<b>(take a coffee break while Fink downloads and compiles the base packages)</b>
...

You should now have a working Fink installation in '/sw'.
[frodo:~/fink-0.39.3] testuser% <b>cd</b>
[frodo:~] testuser% <b>rm -r fink-0.39.3</b>
[frodo:~] testuser% <b>/sw/bin/pathsetup.sh</b></pre>
<p>
The last command runs a little script to help set up your Unix paths
(and other things) for use with Fink.  In most cases, it will run
automatically, and prompt you for permission to make changes.  If
the script fails, you'll have to do things by hand (see below).
</p>
<p>
(If you need to do things by hand, and you are using csh or tcsh,
you need to make sure that the command 
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">source /sw/bin/init.csh</tt> is executed during startup of
your shell, either by .login, .cshrc, .tcshrc, or something else
appropriate.  If you are using bash or similar shells, the command
you need is <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">. /sw/bin/init.sh</tt>, and places where it
might get executed include .bashrc and .profile.)
</p>
<p>
Once you have set up the paths, open a new Terminal.app window, and close
all other ones.
That's it, you now have a base Fink system installed.
</p>
<p>
Before you can install additional packages, you will need to download their
descriptions.  To do this, in your new Terminal.app window, ether use:</p>
<pre>[frodo:~] testuser% <b>fink selfupdate-rsync</b>
Password: <b>(your normal password here)</b>
Please note: the simple command 'fink selfupdate' should be used for routine
updating; you only need to use a command like 'fink selfupdate-cvs' or 'fink
selfupdate --method=rsync' if you are changing your update method.
...
<b>(wait for the downloads to finish)</b></pre>
<p> (preferred) or</p>
<pre>[frodo:~] testuser% <b>fink selfupdate-cvs</b>
Password: <b>(your normal password here)</b>

Please note: the simple command 'fink selfupdate' should be used for routine
updating; you only need to use a command like 'fink selfupdate-cvs' or 'fink
selfupdate --method=rsync' if you are changing your update method. 

fink is setting your default update method to cvs

Fink has the capability to run the CVS commands as a normal user. That has some
advantages - it uses that user's CVS settings files and allows the package
descriptions to be edited and updated without becoming root. Please specify the
user login name that should be used: [&lt;your username&gt;] <b>(press return)</b>

For Fink developers only: Enter your SourceForge login name to set up full CVS
access. Other users, just press return to set up anonymous read-only access.
[anonymous] <b>(press return)</b>

Checking to see if we can use hard links to merge the existing tree. Please
ignore errors on the next few lines.
Now logging into the CVS server. When CVS asks you for a password, just press
return (i.e. the password is empty).
/usr/bin/su hansen -c 'cvs -d":pserver:anonymous@fink.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fink" login'
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@fink.cvs.sourceforge.net:2401/cvsroot/fink
CVS password: <b>(press return)</b>
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@fink.cvs.sourceforge.net:2401/cvsroot/fink
...
<b>(wait for the downloads to finish)</b></pre>
<p>
especially if you are using a proxy.    
</p>
<p>
You can now install packages with the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink</tt>
command, like this:
</p>
<pre>[frodo:~] testuser% <b>fink install gimp2</b>

</p></li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="install-first.directory">2.2 Choosing A Directory</a></h3>
<p>
Before you install, you must decide where Fink's directory hierarchy
will live. The recommended place is /sw, and all examples in this
document will use that. Any other directory should be fine as well, as
long as you don't use existing directories like /usr/local or
/usr. The bootstrap script tries to catch these.
</p>
<p>
The directory that you choose must not contain any spaces or similar characters.
Both Unix itself and the bulk of Unix software were written under this
assumption.
Using symlinks to trick the bootstrap script simply won't work.
</p>


<h3><a name="install-first.install">2.3 Installation</a></h3>
<p>
First, you need to unpack the fink-0.39.3.tar.gz tarball (it might also show up as <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink-0.39.3.tar</tt> if you
used Safari to download it).  So, in a terminal window, go to the directory where you put the tarball, and run this
command:
</p>
<pre>tar xf fink-0.39.3.tar.gz</pre>
<p>
You now have a directory named fink-0.39.3.
Change to it with <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">cd fink-0.39.3</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The actual installation is performed by the perl script
bootstrap.
So, to start installation, go to the fink-0.39.3 directory and run
this command:
</p>
<pre>./bootstrap</pre>
<p>
After running some tests, the script will ask you what method should
be used to gain root privileges.
The most useful choice is 'sudo'.
On a default install of Mac OS X, sudo is already enabled for the user
account created during installation.
The script will immediately use the method you choose to become root.
This is required for the installation.
</p>
<p>
Next, the script will ask you for the installation path.
See 'Choosing A Directory' above for hints about this.
The script will create the directory and set it up for the bootstrap
that will be done later.
</p>
<p>
Next up is Fink configuration.
The process should be self-explaining.
You will be asked how you want to set up
fink's build user account.  If you are on a networked system where
the users and groups are on a central server, you can select the
parameters manually--check with your network administrator as to
what to use.
You will also be asked about proxies--again, check with your network
administrator, and to select mirror sites for downloads.
If you don't know what to say, you can just press Return and Fink will
use a reasonable default value.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the script has enough information to conduct the bootstrap
process.
That means it will now download, build and install some essential
packages.
Don't worry if you see some packages apparently being compiled twice.
This is required because to build a binary package of the package
manager, you first must have the package manager available.
</p>
<p>Note:  on 10.8, 10.9, and 10.10, after you start the install process you may see
dialog windows asking whether you want to install XQuartz.
If you want to do so, go ahead.  You won't have to stop the Fink install
to do that.</p>
<p>
After the bootstrap procedure finishes, run<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/bin/pathsetup.sh</tt>
to help set up your shell environment for use with Fink.  In most cases, it will run
automatically, and prompt you for permission to make changes.  If
the script fails, you'll have to do things by hand (see below).</p>
<p>
(If you need to do things by hand, and you are using csh or tcsh,
you need to make sure that the command 
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">source /sw/bin/init.csh</tt> is executed during startup of
your shell, either by .login, .cshrc, .tcshrc, or something else
appropriate.  If you are using bash or similar shells, the command
you need is <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">. /sw/bin/init.sh</tt>, and places where it
might get executed include .bashrc and .profile.)
</p>
<p>
Once your environment is set up, start a new terminal window to ensure that
the changes get implemented.  You will now need to have Fink download package
descriptions for you.</p>
<p>
You can use 
</p>
<pre>fink selfupdate-rsync</pre>
<p>
to download package descriptions using rsync.  This is the preferred option for
most users, since it is quick and there are multiple mirror sites available.
</p>
<p>
However, rsync is often blocked by network administrators.  If your firewall
doesn't allow you to use rsync, then you can try
</p>

<pre>fink selfupdate-cvs</pre>
<p>
to download package descriptions using cvs.  If you have an HTTP proxy set up, fink
will pass its information along to cvs.  Note: you can only use anonymous cvs (pserver)
through a proxy.
</p>
<p>
You can now use <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink</tt> commands to install packages.
</p>
<pre>fink --help</pre>
<p>
is a useful place to get more information about how to use <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink</tt>.
</p>


<h3><a name="install-first.x11">2.4 Getting X11 Sorted Out</a></h3>
<p>
Fink uses virtual packages to declare dependencies on X11.  As of
OS 10.6, we don't provide any packages of our own.  The supported options are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>10.9:  Only XQuartz 2.7.4 and later.</p></li>
<li><p>10.10-11:  Only XQuartz 2.7.7 and later.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
For more information on installing and running X11, refer to the
online <a href="/doc/x11/">X11 on Darwin
and Mac OS X document</a>.
</p>


<h2><a name="install-up03">3 Upgrading Fink</a></h2>




<p>
You can update Fink with the built-in 'selfupdate' command.  Note:  this is <b>not</b>
guaranteed to be sufficient if you updated OS X.
</p>


<h3><a name="install-up03.packman">3.1 Updating The Package Manager</a></h3>
<p>
To update Fink, run the following command:
</p>
<pre>fink selfupdate</pre>
<p>
This will automatically update your existing Fink installation to
use the latest package manager, and also update all essential
packages. However, it will not update any other packages.
</p>


<h3><a name="install-up03.update-all">3.2 Updating Packages</a></h3>
<p>
The above updating steps will not update the actual packages, they
only provide you with the means to do so. The easiest way to get the
new packages is to use the 'update-all' command:
</p>
<pre>fink update-all</pre>
<p>
This will bring all installed packages to the latest version.
If you don't want to do this (it may take some time), you can update
individual packages with the 'update' command.
</p>


<h2><a name="install-up02">4 Clean Upgrade</a></h2>




<p>
    There are situations, which normally don't come up every day, in which you
    may find that you need to install Fink over again.
</p>


<h3><a name="install-up02.cleaninst">4.1 Situations Calling for a Clean Reinstall</a></h3>

        <p>You want to update, or have already updated, OS X between versions
        where Fink doesn't support an upgrade path:</p>
        <p>- 10.4 -&gt; 10.6+</p>
        <p>- 10.5 -&gt; 10.7+</p>
        <p>- 10.6 -&gt; 10.7+</p>
        <p>- 10.8- -&gt; 10.9+</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Your Fink installation has linked to libraries, e.g. from MacPorts
        or <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/local</tt>, which have been removed from
        your machine thereby breaking some of your Fink libraries and
        executables.</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="install-up02.backup">4.2 Backing up to save time</a></h3>
<p>
To save time after you have reinstalled Fink, you can get a transcript
of your installed packages.  The following command in a terminal window
will work, even if for some reason the Fink tools aren't functioning:
</p>
<pre>grep -B1 "install ok installed" /sw/var/lib/dpkg/status \
| grep "^Package:" | cut -d: -f2 | cut -d\  -f2 &gt; finkinst.txt</pre>
<p>
This will save the list of your packages in the file <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">finkinst.txt</tt>
in the current working directory.
</p>
<p>
You may also want to copy or move the sources in <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/src</tt>
to another location so that you don't have to spend time downloading them when
you begin restoring your Fink distribution.
</p>
<p>
In addition, if you have made global configuration changes to any of your packages by
editing configuration files in <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/etc</tt>, then you may wish to back
those up.
</p>


<h3><a name="install-up02.removing">4.3 Removing Your Old Fink</a></h3>
<p>
Once you've <a href="#install-up02.backup">backed everything up</a>, you are ready
to remove your Fink distribution.  You can remove <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw</tt> as well as
anything in <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/Applications/Fink</tt>
using the Finder or the command line:
</p>
<pre>sudo rm -rf /sw /Applications/Fink/*</pre>
<p>
(Replace <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw</tt> by your actual Fink tree).
</p>


<h3><a name="install-up02.reinstalling">4.4 Installing Fink Again</a></h3>
<p>
First, follow the <a href="#install-first">first-time install instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have downloaded package descriptions, you can put the sources that you
    <a href="#install-up02.backup">backed up</a> into <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/src</tt> either
    using the Finder or the command line:
</p>
<pre>sudo cp /path/to/backup/* /sw/src</pre>
<p>
    (As usual, replace <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw</tt> with your Fink tree).  If you prefer,  you can
    use <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink configure</tt> to specify your backup location:
</p>
<pre>In what additional directory should Fink look for downloaded tarballs? [] 
<b>(enter your backup directory at the prompt)</b>. 
</pre>
<p>
    Note: this requires that the entire path to and including your backup directory is world-readable.
</p>
<p>
    You can also restore your global configuration files at this time.  
    Note:  we recommend that you <b>not</b> restore <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/etc/fink.conf</tt>
    from your prior installation of Fink, to avoid incompatibilities.  You can open it up 
    in a text editor and enter the correponding values into <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink configure</tt>.
