	  (-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future)
	* Bugfix: fix issue with bootstrapping with no Xcode.app installed.
	* Additional fixes  
	  
0.36.3.1 (2013-12-30)
	* Bugfix: fix dpkg-lockwait and apt-get-lockwait on 10.6/i386

0.35.2 "BYOB" (2013-09-26)
	* Bugfix: Fix bootstrap/build under 10.8/Xcode 5.
	* Support OS 10.8.5.
	* Bugfix: Fix 'fink dumpinfo' output for PatchFileN.
	* Validation::_min_fink_version() replaced by more generic
	  Validation::_require_dep().

0.35.1 "BBQ" (2013-07-08)
	* Bugfix:  10.5-EOL was still visible.  Fix that.

0.35.0 "TLA" (2013-07-05)
	* First release to support only Snow Leopard (10.6) and later.
	* Support OS 10.8.4.
	* Add detection for Java-1.7.0.
	* Have fink display the help text if given an unknown verb.  This lets "fink help"
	  and "fink --help" give the same output and reduces surprises. :-)
	* Prevent package builds/installs if there is no upgrade path between the prior
	  Distribution and the current OS.
	* We appear to need the fixes from both 0.34.7 and 0.34.8 for hanging tar, so 
	  we'll have both.
	* For MakeMaker builds:  Override the default "g(cc|++)2-4.2" compiler option 
	  given by the system's Perl on 10.6 in favor of our "g(cc|++)" wrapper, since
	  gcc-4.2 isn't present for clean Xcode 4.2 installs, and our wrapper is equivalent
	  (and contains arch information) for Xcode 3.2.x.
	* Validation::_min_fink_version() API change to allow more generic dependencies.
	  Example:  Depends: fink (>= 0.32) now automatically satisfies BuildDepends 
	  fink (>= 0.32).  Similarly, Depends: automatically satisfies RuntimeDepends.

/-------------
| fink 0.34.x
\-------------

0.34.9 "recessed" (2013-07-05)
	* Last release to support Leopard (10.5.x).
	* Have fink display the help text if given an unknown verb.  This lets "fink help"
	  and "fink --help" give the same output and reduces surprises. :-)
	* Prevent package builds/installs if there is no upgrade path between the prior
	  Distribution and the current OS.
	* Validation::_min_fink_version() API change to allow more generic dependencies.
	  Example:  Depends: fink (>= 0.32) now automatically satisfies BuildDepends 
	  fink (>= 0.32).  Similarly, Depends: automatically satisfies RuntimeDepends.
=== in common with 0.35.0 ===
	* Support OS 10.8.4.
	* Add detection for Java-1.7.0.
	* We appear to need the fixes from both 0.34.7 and 0.34.8 for hanging tar, so 
	  we'll have both.
	* For MakeMaker builds:  Override the default "g(cc|++)2-4.2" compiler option

	  (and contains arch information) for Xcode 3.2.x.
	
0.34.8 "duct tape" (2013-05-08)
	* More general fix to the hanging tar issue.  Thanks to Eric Gallager (cooljeanius)

	* Improved "fink list --dotty-build".
	* Suggest using "fink configure" when facing legacy fink.conf path issue.
	* clang and clang++ wrappers, mostly for 10.6/i386.
	* Other bugfixes.

0.34.7 "overhead track" (2013-03-29)
	* Bugfix: address issue where fink's tar hangs during unpack operations. Thanks to
	  Peter Dyballa for the workaround.

0.34.6 "Hook and loop" (2013-03-16)
	* Support 10.8.3.
	* Clean up error reports from missing system commands.

0.34.5 "suction cup hook" (2013-01-28)
	* Fix clang virtual package detection against Xcode 4.6+.
	* Update 10.4/base and 10.7/base package description files to match latest versions
	  in bootstrap.
	* Removed a number of spurious virtual perlmods.
	* Check for valid Buildpath and FetchAltDir during 'fink configure'.
	* Additional documentation.

0.34.4 "Ceiling Mount" (2012-09-25)
	* Support 10.8.2 and 10.7.5
	* Check permissions in working directories to make sure that fink-bld can
	  operate.
	
0.34.3 "wall anchor" (2012-08-29)
	* Support 10.8.1.
	* Move Essential packages to gettext8.
	* Update 10.4/base and 10.7/base package description files to match latest versions
	  in bootstrap.
	* Bugfixes
		* Fix .deb validator test for compiled perlmods.
		* Remove fontconfig2 and xft2 from x11 virtual package Provides,
		  since we're using Fink packages for those exclusively now.
		* Update fink.conf manpage to include Distribution: 10.8.

0.34.2 "magnetic" (2012-08-04)
	* Bugfixes
		* Fix test for unused UIDs/GIDs in Services.pm to allow checking
		  them separately.  This permits fink to restore the fink-bld user when
		  the Mountain Lion installer clobbers the user but not the group.
		* BuildAsNobody: false issues:
		  * Don't have fink-bld own directories in such cases.
		  * SplitOffs should inherit the same behavior as their parent.
		* Scrub a newline when finding the Developer directory via backticks
		  in AppBundles generation  (thanks to J. Steverud for the diagnosis).

0.34.1 "hanger" (2012-07-26)
	* Add a "pre-build-test.sh" script to check for system executables that fink
	  needs.
	  * Currently we test for presence and executability of /usr/bin/pod2man.
	  * Modified the following to run pre-build-test.sh:
	  	* fink.info.in -> fink-*.info
	  	* inject.pl (replaces check from 0.34.0)
	  	* bootstrap (replaces check from 0.34.0)
	* Bugfixes
		* Use the results of the 64-bit Intel check in bootstrap to determine
		  whether users are offered the option of a 64-bit install.
		* Remove virtual package for IPC::Run3 since no system Perl actually
		  provides it.
		* Restore ability to run SplitForks on app bundles when using Xcode 4.3 and later
		  by switching from hardcoded /Developer to a portable construct.
		* Fix parsing of indented TarFilesRename fields.
		* Fix order of entries in %p/var/lib/dpkg/info/<package>.md5sums .
	* Add this file to the files installed by fink.

0.34.0 "bracket" (2012-07-16)
	* Initial Mountain Lion support.
	* Refuse to bootstrap when /usr/bin/pod2man isn't executable.
	* Use only Apple- or Fink-provided helper applications, e.g. rsync
	  rather than arbitrary, possibly broken, third-party ones.
	* The only downloader which is now provided by Apple is curl, so stop
	  checking in /usr/bin for wget, aria2, ....

| fink 0.33.x
\-------------

0.33.3 "Higgsino" (2012-07-05)
	* Bugfix: force fink to put temporary scripts in /tmp when building as
	  fink-bld to avoid failures under "sudo -E -s" and "su -m". 
	* Generate the MD5sums of all of the files for a package.  These are available
	  under %p/var/lib/dpkg/info/<package>.md5sums.
	* Suppress STDERR messages from xcodebuild for folks who insist on _not_
	  having Xcode.app.
	* Have the Version for xcode (>=4.3.0) correspond to the entire version string
	  from "pkgutil --pkg-info com.apple.pkg.DeveloperToolsCLI".
	* Bugfix: 0.33.3.1: fixes and performance improvements in the md5sum routine.
	* Bugfix: 0.33.3.2: more fixes for the md5sum generator

0.33.2 "sup squark" (2012-06-20)
	* Bugfix:
		* Use output from '/usr/libexec/java_home' to generate default 
		  JAVA_HOME for builds.
		* This works on 10.5-10.7, so it's probably going to change at some
		  point without warning. :-)
	* Better logic in checking for the expected gcc compilers.

0.33.1 "Wino" (2012-06-12)
	* Bug fixes:
		* Justin Hallett discovered that 'id' from coreutils-default and 
		  /usr/bin/id behave differently, which causes the fink-bld user
		  not to get set up properly.  Hardcoding /usr/bin/id solves this.
		* Fixed stray diagnostic message from system SDK detection (Thanks 
		  to Remko Scharoo for the report).
	
0.33.0 "selectron" (2012-06-11)
    * Recognize OS 10.7.4.
	* Make fink use --build-as-nobody by default.
		* move creation of fink-bld user, if not already present, into fink
		  rather than passwd(-fink-bld).
		* If not present, use 'fink configure' to set up the fink-bld user's
		  parameters, and it will be created on the next operation where a 
		  build could occur.
		* BuildAsNobody: false field for .info files where the package can't be 
	  	  built as nobody.
		* --no-build-as-nobody option for fink to override this default option 
	  	  and build as root.
	* %p/Library/Python is now a legal directory.
	* Modify the versioning of the "xcode" virtual package.
	    * Version of the CLI Tools, if those are installed, for OS 10.7+.
	    * Still the version of Xcode.app for Xcode 4.2.1-.
	* "xcode.app" virtual package indicates the presence of Xcode.app, and its 
	  version is the version of the app for all Xcode versions.  
	* Diagnostic output modifications for packages that have UseMaxBuildJobs:
	  false.

/-------------
| fink 0.32.x
\-------------

0.32.6 "unicycle" (2012-04-14)
	* Add validator support for 'BuildAsNobody: false' in preparation for
	  making --build-as-nobody the default build method.

0.32.5 "spinning" (2012-04-07)
	* Supports bootstrap with only the Xcode Command Line Tools.
	* clang virtual package
	* llvm-gcc virtual package
	* Clean up gcc* virtual packages:
		* Get rid of compilers in the defaults list that aren't available
		  for any modern Xcode.
		* Use an OS version dependent list so that users can tell whether
		  they need to install a different Xcode or if the package is just
		  wrong. :-)
	* Bugfixes:
	  	* Message concerning RuntimeDepends now mentions fink (>=0.32.0) 
	  	  rather than the less user-friendly (>=0.31.99.git).
	  	* Have a default value if no system SDKs are found to avoid 
	  	  "unitialized value" errors.
	  	* 0.32.5 -> 0.32.5.2: these updates didn't get applied.
	  	* 0.32.5.2 -> 0.32.5.3:  10.7 needs gcc4.2, not gcc4.0.
	  	* 0.32.5.3 -> 0.32.5.4:  Fix some regressions from master,
	  	  including bootstrap text.
	  	* 0.32.5.5:  Fix bootstrap on PowerPC.

0.32.4 "pedicab" (2012-03-27)
	* Improved checksum validation.
	* Enhance Xcode 4.3 support via the use of syscalls rather than
	  hardcoded paths.
		* Other locations for Xcode.app than just /Applications.
		* System SDK's now show up again.
	* Make list of potential system SDKs OS-version dependent rather than
	  one list for everybody, to avoid user confusion if a package Bdeps
	  on an SDK which is *nonexistent* for a given Xcode (immediate failure
	  mention package unavailaibility versus more verbose message telling
	  user to install that SDK from Xcode).  SDKs which _can_ be installed
	  will still give a message telling the user to install them from Xcode.

0.32.3 "velocipede" (2012-02-16)
	* Support Xcode 4.3

0.32.2 "ordinary" (2012-02-03)
	* Bugfix: flag to use pax as the unarchiver was not getting unset for
	  the next SourceN.
	* Support OS 10.7.3.

0.32.1 "penny-farthing" (2012-01-26)
	* Bugfix: get_build_directory() needed to include tar.xz as an option or 
	  packages with a simple Source: foo.tar.xz would fail.

0.32.0 "recumbent" (2012-01-25)
	* Added new "RuntimeDepends" field, any .info file that wants to use this
	  feature must BuildDepend on fink (>= 0.32.0-1).
	* Improved package validator to reject .deb files including .hg / .git
	  directories.
	* Improved package validator to detect some issues with percent expansions.
	* Cleaned up the code base, including removal of some dead code for old OS X
	  version, and anything related to the AddShlibDeps .info field.
	* Updated fink and fink.conf man pages.
	* Disallow bootstrapping into /usr/local and any subdir of it.
	* Disallow bootstrapping on OS X 10.4 and older.
	* Removed the obsolete prebinding code (it was for OS X 10.4 and older).
	* Let 'tar' handle compressed tar files directly.  
	* xz archive support.
		* Includes validation check with 0.32 as minimum fink
		  version for .xz formatted archives.
		* Automatic unpacking source files in .tar.xz format.
		* Automatically install the xz package with no need to declare a 
		  BuildDepend when a SourceN is a .xz file.
	* Check Xcode version in bootstrap phase before actually creating a Fink tree.
	* Check for -I or -L pointing to the builddir or install dir in .pc files.
	* Diagnostic message improvements
		* Mention "passwd-fink-bld" instead of "passwd" when the fink-bld user
		  is absent, since there's no "passwd" on 10.7.
		* In error messages, suggest that users try rebuilds with MaxBuildJobs: 1
		  if that's set higher, and print MBJ in the system info.
		* Stress emailing _only one_ Fink mailing list for bug reports.

| fink 0.31.x (see https://github.com/fink/fink/tree/branch_0_31)
\-------------

0.31.6 "supine" (2012-01-03)
	* BugFixes: cvs proxy tunnel doesn't support 'user:password', so strip that
				that from information passed via ProxyHTTP.
				ext method doesn't support proxy tunneling.

0.31.5 "deceit" (2011-11-21)
	* BugFix: gcc-4.2 isn't available after clean installs of Xcode 4.2, so
	  users weren't able to bootstrap on 10.6/Xcode 4.2.  Revert the compiler
	  wrappers to point to gcc|g++ rather than (gcc|g++)-4.2.

0.31.4 "perfidy" (2011-10-28)
	* Synced base .info files against latest versions from dists.
	* Added support for Xcode 4.2 on Mac OS X 10.6.
	* Fixed bootstrap issue when GNU sed is in the PATH.
	* Updated mirror list.

0.31.3 "mendacity" (2011-10-12)
	* Added support for Mac OS X 10.7.2.
	* Added support for App Store version of Growl.app as well as legacy prefpane.

0.31.2 "perjury" (2011-09-26)
	* No longer enforce "BDep:fink>=0.24.12" for use of PatchFile (nothing older
	  than that would be usable now anyway)
	* Building with the number of threads specified by MaxBuildJobs is now
	  default (i.e. UseMaxBuildJobs: true is the default) unless 
	  MaxBuildJobs: false is set.
	* InstallScript always disables UseMaxBuildJobs.

0.31.1 ""little white"" (2011-09-11)
	* Added support for Mac OS X 10.7.1.
	* Allow 32 bit systems to bootstrap on 10.6.
	* Simplified some code by taking advantage of the fact that the minimal
	  supported OS version now is 10.5.
	* Bug fixes

0.31.0 "fib" (2011-07-20)
	* Added support for Mac OS X 10.7.
	* Dropped support for any Mac OS X version before 10.5. So 10.5, 10.6 and
	  10.7 are the only supported OS X versions now.
	* Bug fixes

Bug fixes
	* Fink no longer gets confused by debs in a local apt repository
	* When asking to choose mirrors, fink orders choices alphabetically
	  properly, and presents a reasonable set of mirrors when the user
	  asks for all those on a continent.
	* BuildConflicts should actually work
	* many more we've forgotten all about...
