| fink 0.32.x
\-------------

0.32.5 "spinning" (2012-04-07)
	* Supports bootstrap with only the Xcode Command Line Tools.
	* clang virtual package
	* llvm-gcc virtual package
	* Clean up gcc* virtual packages:
		* Get rid of compilers in the defaults list that aren't available
		  for any modern Xcode.
		* Use an OS version dependent list so that users can tell whether
		  they need to install a different Xcode or if the package is just
		  wrong. :-)
	* Bugfixes:
	  	* Message concerning RuntimeDepends now mentions fink (>=0.32.0) 
	  	  rather than the less user-friendly (>=0.31.99.git).
	  	* Have a default value if no system SDKs are found to avoid 
	  	  "unitialized value" errors.
	  	* 0.32.5 -> 0.32.5.2: these updates didn't get applied.
	  	* 0.32.5.2 -> 0.32.5.3:  10.7 needs gcc4.2, not gcc4.0.
	  	* 0.32.5.3 -> 0.32.5.4:  Fix some regressions from master,
	  	  including bootstrap text.

0.32.4 "pedicab" (2012-03-27)
	* Improved checksum validation.
	* Enhance Xcode 4.3 support via the use of syscalls rather than
	  hardcoded paths.
		* Other locations for Xcode.app than just /Applications.
		* System SDK's now show up again.
	* Make list of potential system SDKs OS-version dependent rather than
	  one list for everybody, to avoid user confusion if a package Bdeps
	  on an SDK which is *nonexistent* for a given Xcode (immediate failure
	  mention package unavailaibility versus more verbose message telling
	  user to install that SDK from Xcode).  SDKs which _can_ be installed
	  will still give a message telling the user to install them from Xcode.

0.32.3 "velocipede" (2012-02-16)
	* Support Xcode 4.3

0.32.2 "ordinary" (2012-02-03)
	* Bugfix: flag to use pax as the unarchiver was not getting unset for
	  the next SourceN.
	* Support OS 10.7.3.

0.32.1 "penny-farthing" (2012-01-26)
	* Bugfix: get_build_directory() needed to include tar.xz as an option or 
	  packages with a simple Source: foo.tar.xz would fail.

0.32.0 "recumbent" (2012-01-25)
	* Added new "RuntimeDepends" field, any .info file that wants to use this
	  feature must BuildDepend on fink (>= 0.32.0-1).
	* Improved package validator to reject .deb files including .hg / .git
	  directories.
	* Improved package validator to detect some issues with percent expansions.
	* Cleaned up the code base, including removal of some dead code for old OS X
	  version, and anything related to the AddShlibDeps .info field.
	* Updated fink and fink.conf man pages.
	* Disallow bootstrapping into /usr/local and any subdir of it.
	* Disallow bootstrapping on OS X 10.4 and older.
	* Removed the obsolete prebinding code (it was for OS X 10.4 and older).
	* Let 'tar' handle compressed tar files directly.  
	* xz archive support.
		* Includes validation check with 0.32 as minimum fink
		  version for .xz formatted archives.
		* Automatic unpacking source files in .tar.xz format.
		* Automatically install the xz package with no need to declare a 
		  BuildDepend when a SourceN is a .xz file.
	* Check Xcode version in bootstrap phase before actually creating a Fink tree.
	* Check for -I or -L pointing to the builddir or install dir in .pc files.
	* Diagnostic message improvements
		* Mention "passwd-fink-bld" instead of "passwd" when the fink-bld user
		  is absent, since there's no "passwd" on 10.7.
		* In error messages, suggest that users try rebuilds with MaxBuildJobs: 1
		  if that's set higher, and print MBJ in the system info.
		* Stress emailing _only one_ Fink mailing list for bug reports.

/-------------
| fink 0.31.x (see https://github.com/fink/fink/tree/branch_0_31)
\-------------

0.31.6 "supine" (2012-01-03)
	* BugFixes: cvs proxy tunnel doesn't support 'user:password', so strip that
				that from information passed via ProxyHTTP.
				ext method doesn't support proxy tunneling.

0.31.5 "deceit" (2011-11-21)
	* BugFix: gcc-4.2 isn't available after clean installs of Xcode 4.2, so
	  users weren't able to bootstrap on 10.6/Xcode 4.2.  Revert the compiler
	  wrappers to point to gcc|g++ rather than (gcc|g++)-4.2.

0.31.4 "perfidy" (2011-10-28)
	* Synced base .info files against latest versions from dists.
	* Added support for Xcode 4.2 on Mac OS X 10.6.
	* Fixed bootstrap issue when GNU sed is in the PATH.
	* Updated mirror list.

0.31.3 "mendacity" (2011-10-12)
	* Added support for Mac OS X 10.7.2.
	* Added support for App Store version of Growl.app as well as legacy prefpane.

0.31.2 "perjury" (2011-09-26)
	* No longer enforce "BDep:fink>=0.24.12" for use of PatchFile (nothing older
	  than that would be usable now anyway)
	* Building with the number of threads specified by MaxBuildJobs is now
	  default (i.e. UseMaxBuildJobs: true is the default) unless 
	  MaxBuildJobs: false is set.
	* InstallScript always disables UseMaxBuildJobs.

0.31.1 ""little white"" (2011-09-11)
	* Added support for Mac OS X 10.7.1.
	* Allow 32 bit systems to bootstrap on 10.6.
	* Simplified some code by taking advantage of the fact that the minimal
	  supported OS version now is 10.5.
	* Bug fixes

0.31.0 "fib" (2011-07-20)
	* Added support for Mac OS X 10.7.
	* Dropped support for any Mac OS X version before 10.5. So 10.5, 10.6 and
	  10.7 are the only supported OS X versions now.
	* Bug fixes
