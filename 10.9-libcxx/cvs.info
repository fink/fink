Description: Version control system
DescDetail: <<
 CVS is the Concurrent Versions System, the dominant open-source
 network-transparent version control system. CVS is useful for
 everyone from individual developers to large, distributed teams:
	- Its client-server access method lets developers access the
	  latest code from anywhere there's an Internet connection.
	- Its unreserved check-out model to version control avoids
	  artificial conflicts common with the exclusive check-out model.
	- Its client tools are available on most platforms.
This version is based on the upstream "feature" tree.  If you need to downgrade
for any reason, either just remove the package and use the builtin version
(1.11.20 for the 2.2 and later XCode tools), or install the "cvs-stable" 
package.

 "Enabling this on a case insensitive system should
  have little effect on the server or client
  operation":  from the help text in the configure script.
