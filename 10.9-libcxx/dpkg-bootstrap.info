Description: The Debian package manager (bootstrap only)
DescDetail: <<
dpkg installs and removes binary packages; it is the base of the
distribution. This package also contains some helper programs. This
package does not build dselect and thus doesn't require ncurses. It is
intended to be used during bootstrap.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
  admindir goes in %P (eventual live basedir) not %p (bootstrap
  basedir): dpkg-bootstrap needs to set up the initial live dpkg
  status database.

  removed Depends and BuildDepends since this is built during phase two
  of bootstrap and those fields are not relevant there
<<
DescPort: <<
1.10.9 
- Removed --without-zlib flag
- Gets confused about top_srcdir without the --srcdir arg.
- Fixed bug with BR manpage
- Patched update-rc.d out of the app check code, not needed on OS X.

Pre-Jaguar: Needed fixes to use the right architecture, disable code that uses
unimplemented functions on Darwin and other stuff.

Added code to support the pseudo package 'macosx' and 'darwin'.

Fix to install-info script to prevent a certain problem with section titles.

Patched to run 'fink-virtual-pkgs' to see what packages we have outside of $prefix.

Patched to suppress warning about BuildDependsOnly control field.

Previous versions by Christoph Pfisterer.

Patched to not remove Darwin's system-critical symlinks (/etc /tmp /var)

Patched to hardcode complete paths to our component executables
instead of relying on PATH

stpncpy test may fail due to wrong prototype even if we have the
function, so remove AIX-bug-specific hack
