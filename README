 Fink ReadMe
=============

This is Fink, a package management system that aims to bring the full world
of Open Source software to Darwin and Mac OS X.

With the help of dpkg, it maintains a separate directory hierarchy. It
downloads original source releases, patches them if necessary, configures
them for Darwin and compiles and installs them. The information about
available packages and the necessary patches (the "package descriptions")
are maintained separately, but are usually included with this distribution.
The actual source code is downloaded from the Internet as necessary.

Although Fink cannot be considered "mature" and it has some rough edges and
lacking features, it is successfully used by a large number of people.
Please read the instructions carefully and don't be surprised if something
doesn't work as expected. There are good explanations for most failures;
check the website if you need help.

Fink is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. See the
file COPYING for details.


 Requirements
--------------
You need:

 * An installed Mac OS X system, version 10.7 or later.

 * The Xcode Command Line Tools are mandatory. This package can be installed
   either by downloading it directly via developer.apple.com, through the
   Xcode application, on via the Components page of the Downloads tab of the
   Preferences on 10.7 and 10.8, or on 10.9 and 10.10 by running the

      xcode-select --install

   command and choosing the Install button in the window that pops up, or
   you can install the full Xcode if you prefer. You may also need to use
   this command to update the tools, especially if you're having build
   problems.

   If you're doing a manual download, make sure that the tools you install
   match your Mac OS X version as well as your Xcode app version (if that is
   present).

 * Java. Entering

      javac

   from a Terminal.app window should suffice to make the system download it
   for you.

 * Internet access. All source code is downloaded from mirror sites.

 * Patience. Compiling several big packages takes time. I'm talking hours or
   even days here.


 Installation
--------------
The installation process is described in detail in the file INSTALL. Please
read it first, the process is non-trivial. It also describes the upgrade
procedure.


 Using Fink
------------
The file USAGE describes how to set your paths and how to install and remove
packages. It also has a complete list of available commands.
