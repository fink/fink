 Fink ReadMe
=============

This is Fink, a package management system that aims to bring the full world
of Open Source software to Darwin and Mac OS X.

With the help of dpkg, it maintains a separate directory hierarchy. It
downloads original source releases, patches them if necessary, configures
them for Darwin and compiles and installs them. The information about
available packages and the necessary patches (the "package descriptions")
are maintained separately, but are usually included with this distribution.
The actual source code is downloaded from the Internet as necessary.

Although Fink cannot be considered "mature" and it has some rough edges and
lacking features, it is successfully used by a large number of people.
Please read the instructions carefully and don't be surprised if something
doesn't work as expected. There are good explanations for most failures;
check the website if you need help.

Fink is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. See the
file COPYING for details.


 Requirements
--------------
You need:

 * An installed Mac OS X system, version 10.0 or later. (There may still be
   some stray linker-related problems with 10.1.) Darwin 1.3.1 should also
   work, but this has not been tested. Earlier versions of both will not
   work.

 * Development tools. On Mac OS X, install the Developer.pkg package from
   the Developer Tools CD. Make sure that the tools you install match your
   Mac OS X version. On Darwin, the tools should be present in the default
   install.

 * Internet access. All source code is downloaded from mirror sites.

 * Patience. Compiling several big packages takes time. I'm talking hours or
   even days here.


 Installation
--------------
The installation process is described in detail in the file INSTALL. Please
read it first, the process is non-trivial. It also describes the upgrade
procedure.


 Using Fink
------------
The file USAGE describes how to set your paths and how to install and remove
packages. It also has a complete list of available commands.
